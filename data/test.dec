Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Forget it.
Cameron.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Let me see what I can do.
Where?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
Let's go.
They do not!
Who?
Is he oily or dry?
Expensive?
Hi, Joey.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Exactly my point
Daddy, no!
The prom?  Kat has a date?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
No, I ' m not.
Yeah -- we'll see.
She kissed me.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
A deal's a deal.
Are you lost?
We're not.
Does it matter?
No fear.
I didn't have a choice.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?

You know who The Raincoats are?
Funny, you're the only one
I just need to lie down for awhile
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
I hate him.
What?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Something like that
I hate peas.
Go to the prom with me
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Enough!
So what I want doesn't matter?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
When I go?
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
We're your guys.
I'm likin' you guys better
Sweet love, renew thy force!
What's to discuss?
Make anyone cry today?
Pirate -- no question.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
This time with me!
I'm not bargaining!
... for a commoner?
Look out of that window.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
Chief says -- he has a God.
You did the same to your God!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I knew you would.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
God be with us admiral.
Immediately.
The land is there.  I know it!
Yes, Your Majesty.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Then why?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
You bring the cigarettes?
I was all of these.
What else do you need?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
So...the station is empty?
No.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
In the kitchen.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Okay.  But not water sports.
But Chief?  Over this??
You ready?
A timer.
Takin' a bath.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No, what is it?
Nah, why should you?
Of course.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Something back home?
My point exactly.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Then do it, asshole.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Alright?
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
You're ruthless.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Tonight.
Don't be late.
That's unique.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Dog food.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
You'll be my first.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Two weeks holiday.
Okay.
Don't speak Russian!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Shut up.  Look!
No, I don't get that!
Surprise!  Surprise!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
What are you coming here to do?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
I used an accelerant.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Oh yeah, why?
Yeah?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
She's wonderful.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
It's possible.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
What is it, Hal?
Yes, it is.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Goodbye, Daddy.
Well, where are all of you off to?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
I see.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Thank you very much, Hal.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Whaddya mean, buy?
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
No chance.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
What are you talkin' about?
How much?
Jesus.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
You stay with me...
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
There's nothin' to talk about.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Yeah.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
I'm heading out. How about you?
What?
Hey, you know what I really think?
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
That's no bull.
Shut up.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Give it back.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
So you do know her.
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Who?
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
So, just how big was this fare?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Have you pulled yourself together?
You little sleaze bag!
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Crystal.
I'll be right back.
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I want to sleep... forever...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
I love you...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
...What do you mean?
Perfect, Mr. President.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Honey, I'm not, please...
... What's going on?
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
What you see is what I got, mister.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What can I do for you today?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
Where are the women?
I remember him.
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
You betrayed us.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
Fuck you!
What do you want?
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Stop talking.
I'm listening.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
I was well compensated.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Fuck you.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Max.
There's not much illegal.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Snuff films.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Nope.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
I'm here.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
How will I get it to you?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Who is this... ?
No...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
What?
Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
It's okay, we're just about there.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
Don't worry, honey
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
He's inside you, where he hides.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Yeah...I guess.
No.  A deal's a deal.
To take a picture.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Sobering...
No, the Dan part was nice...
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
That's the only reason you're alive...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
But I've seen her grave.
Makes you look like a nun--
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Mark...
I can't listen to this.
He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Yes?
But if they <u>do</u>?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
Yes, Griff?
Something wrong?
Why do you say that?
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
Huh?
Take a look.
Minus three.
Come where?
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
All right - go to it.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Twombley involved?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You can't buy Wade off.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Really.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Break stuff?
It's stupid.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It belongs to Pop.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
I want to go home.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
So?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Mel Gordon.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
Yeah.
Forget it.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
You knew me as a kid.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Good.
How?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Can --?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Nothing.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Huh?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
Yeah.
Well, I never heard that one.
I'm sorry, honey.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
He's busy being dead.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Stay cool.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
I prefered the terrorists.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Because it is my duty.
About goddamn time.
Dead.
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
why did they do that?
We're not going to make it.
Where are we now?
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Stand by.
Tower, here.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
I know he left you behind.
You'll do it?
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Gravity.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Can't it wait?
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're handling it, sir.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Yes I did...
Dunn.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Ask Simon.
There's nothing wrong with me!
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Let me by, Elaine.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Not now, Elaine.
That was very well put, Ted.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
That's okay, ROK.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
What?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Yes.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
I can't tell.
A hospital? What is it?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Well...
Ted!
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Who wants to be first?
Yes, Captain?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Would you go up, please?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Yeah...
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
But I-- .
Stay back!  I'm okay.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
My wife?  She worries about me.
You are married?
I appreciate your honesty, George.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
To the... to the beach?
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
We can't let him get away.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
You look very good.
No... two.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Sure.  Just a minute.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Departmental policy.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
What?
See you soon.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
She's right.
Bullshit!
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Let's get these things lit.
Fuckin' A!
Poor bastard.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
No.  Have you?
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Seal the door.
No.. I've slept enough.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
I'm sorry, Newt.
That's right.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Good morning.
A brothel.
What?
Don't bother!
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I want to go back to Vienna.
Yes!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why? People fart backwards.
Em iram! Em iram!
Of course.
Oh, leave me alone.
Well, don't do that again!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
I'm not telling you.
Why?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
He's terribly busy, sir.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
He needs me, ma'am.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Leave him alone!
Adorable!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Michael!
It's just a trifle, of course.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
What? On one hearing only?
Yes, indeed.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Yes, Sire.
I have no idea.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
I will.
How many pupils do you have?
It's a secret.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Good morning, sir.
Really? What is it he's writing?
I don't know. He has pains.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
I'm afraid not.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
How could it not, Excellency?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Are you neglecting my request?
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Oh, yes.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Yes!
I'm not leaving you.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
But, Your Majesty -
Just let me tell you how it begins.
On the contrary.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Do you believe it?
Did you try?
I poisoned his life.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes.
Yes, in the third act.
Well done, Sire!
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
I can't wait.
Excuse me, my dear.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Of course.
The American? Yes, duck.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Yes, Doctor?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Yes, I believe he did.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Is David acting strangely?
No, a cab will be faster.
I beg your pardon?
How is that?
Right.
Will you give me a break?
That's not really a very proper question.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Not just a patient -- me.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Your dead friend Jack?
I would think so.
Very nice.
I wasn't hallucinating.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
A doper werewolf.
The zoo?
I should be committed.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
No.
No!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
You could have told them!
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
I can't stand it.
David!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
What?!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Hi, David.
Hello.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Aw, nerts!
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
You understand?
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
You don't have to do nothing.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Well—
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
John, how's your wife this morning?
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
Tomorrow night?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning.
Yes, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
But I haven't . . .
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Yes, sir.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
All right.
Oh, is that so?
With what?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Yes, why?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Then where were you?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Sometimes a wound will kill.
That was two hours ago.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
How?
He's not bad at it.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What is wrong with you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Sorry.
What will be?
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Which one, right or left?
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
What is it?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
I reckoned.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Ma.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Oh yeah.
Got any ideas, little brother?
So what was he?
Everything but the boring parts.
A fair number, Ma.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Boys?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Shush.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
What?
You are a hell of a woman.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
No.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I just though you were awful cute.
Lyla Devereux.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
They had to be dealt with!
And it is my pleasure to be here.
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
So you can't tell me anything?
I demand action.
Can you put men at all four?
Vengeance.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Yes.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Yes?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
It's not.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Yes, I am.
We never really shared one.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Like what?
Ask me a question.
Leaving what?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Two at nine? Perfect.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Yes, Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Sorry. 
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Does he do this all the time?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
It's no problem
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
No, he just hung out there.
We were both seven in 1969.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
No.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Not in the mood, I guess.
Marcus?
Where was Marcus?
Al.
Oh well, you know.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
No, Owen.
"Make" him?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Isn't that -- extreme?
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Teddy was killed last night.
Milo. Why would he --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Nothing.
Guilt?
...Different?
Great.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Oh hi.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Well -- you sent for me.
I'm sure.
The wrong place?
'Have a look?
...Worse?
Keep looking.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
You know my name.
You're famous around here.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
You're compulsive.
Why would you do a thing like --
But why would they --?
Hmm?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
It's three years old, it --
Let's try #2.
Uh. Not exactly.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
What does that mean?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I could get it out of him.
You may.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you, Exposition.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Be careful.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
What's the other?
Good on ya, man.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me?
Here, use mine.
I couldn't have another bite.
Of course, luv.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
You know who.
Yes.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Danger's my middle name.
That's not mine.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Sure.
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
My son?
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Sea bass.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Not me.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
... bottle ...
... preserve...
... love ...
I have an appointment.
Eh? In here!
This isn't a game.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
He tried to warn us ...
To find out who killed my husband.
Thanks, Valentine ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
1922. Why the kippers?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
June, July ... August?
Frankly that's how I remember it.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Very good, Steed ...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Always.  Except ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Where are you going?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Pity your mother came, too ...
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
You're saying I have no choice.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
I know all this.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
We want Mrs. Peel.
How did you guess?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
That's not playing by the rules.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Bond... James Bond.
Five thousand dollars.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
I'm very happy for you two.
The car for Debbie?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Sure have...
Thank you, sir.
But how can I do that?
1002.
Yes, sir.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
I'm going now, Cole.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
You better not have too much joy.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I am committed. I love you.
You're so romantic...
A real turd.
Any time, Al.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
That's more like it.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Rick!
My gift to you.
Oooooo.
My Debbie?
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Who asked you?
Not likely.
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
Yeah? What about Laura --
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Thanks for the insight.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
-- What are you doing here?
What are we going to do about this?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Really? No kidding.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
How's it going?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Hi.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
It's a small town.
Hey, do I know you?
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Trychticholorate.
What are you listening to?
Glass?
No it couldn't.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
And the putty around the door?
Are you going public with this?
Yeah? Airtight?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
How ya feeling?
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
I was ahead of my time.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
He's going to be a fireman.
The great communicator.
Okay.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Did he tell you how we finally met?
And old ladies?
And the world -- the whole world.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
I might.
I need that report, Lt.
Alderman.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Who?
"The Strawberries"?
I'm a Catholic.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Let me think about it.
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
What case?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
How much?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Mantan!!
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I've never been given a fair shot.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
Go on.  Good so far.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
I don't know about that plantation angle.
We think so.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
How did you end up here?
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Where do you go from here?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Do you know how you will use him?
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
This is Cheeba.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Which one is your brother?
The pleasure is mine.
Everybody shut up.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
A gift.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
That's why it will be so much fun.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
I feel fine.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I can't go all the way down south.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
What's a Negro.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Thank you.  And always smile.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
What do you mean?
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
She hates dem.
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Are you trying to rap to me?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
My people love me.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
I have acted as I think fit.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
And his baggage?
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Your cousins go out with him.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
As you please.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I have faced that problem before.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
That is a trifle strong.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Then you must get it.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Yes?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Can anybody hear me!
We found him like this --
HEY!
What do you mean, alone?
It's... too slow.
I just don't like it.
I'm not telling you what happened.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
But not Pike's.
And the bodies?
Epilepsy.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Can't do that now, though, can you?
Sir, yes, sir!
West's. Any kindling for afire?
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Yeah...
Look in my pack.
You're lying --
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Stop.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
I didn't --
And the problem is you only got three.
Who killed Pike?
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
What the hell are you talking about --
That's horseshit and you know it.
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
That's preposterous --
You're crazy --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Why?
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
So noted.
I don't know.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
You wanted to get the truth.
That's gonna stay my secret.
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
I should probably write that down.
The faggot speaks.
Poor fucker my ass...
So you took off your shirt?
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Sir, yes, sir!
That's great.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Not yet.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Why?
No one's ever left.
Fine, I will.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
How did you know?
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Go.
No, I understand.
I never knew.
What's your name, Giant?
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
So how does it happen?
Really.
Oh, so you know.
I think someone hasn't.
Dad?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Like this.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Story of my life.
There is no softer ground than town.
Probably tonight.
You don't have to.
Did you?
That's because most of it never happened.
You're not.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
Yes. Thank you.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Do you want to stop?
We'll stop then.
What are you doing here?
Ch...
I'm asking what you're here for.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Uh. Do you like England?
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Good night.
What? What does he want?
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
Yes I know.
No I don't.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I don't have any money.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
You...
You don't understand you either.
Get out.
No.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
Goodbye.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
It's more like a date.
Maybe you will find out.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Thanks.
This gonna get you in trouble?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
At church?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
I need ya help again.
Hey.
You gonna miss your bus.
You been home yet?
Stop what?
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Let go...
Let go of my arm...
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Come on, gal...
How long... how long I been out?
Well I don't...
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
No ma'am.
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
I CAN'T!
Uh-uh.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
I don't fuckin' cook.
You drink whiskey?
I ain't in a hurry.
The... chain helps.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Nothin'.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Huh?
Why you say that?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
What'chu sayin'?
Uh-huh.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Why she got a chain on her?
That's right.
You could put it that way.
What's on your mind?
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Rae!
Yeah?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Thought you had a man for that.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Thanks.
Home.
Let go...
Saving your life.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Nick, we can't just --
What'd she say?
Where would you look for the mafia?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Yeah...
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
Sure.
I want to yank Kobo.
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
A wife.  She left.
Me too.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
He's on duty.
Where's Ich?
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Tell them I'm not.
Why would you care?
What if I chant?
Guess I'm on a roll.
Time, I've got plenty of.
What?
What...?  What if I say no?
He was my partner.
Do you know what this is?
Look.
Then go get him.
Well, actually
Nexus - 6.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
His company made us.
He's not ready yet.
She's not with you?
Soon as I finish the job.
Day after tomorrow.
I know all that.
I think we're through for the night.
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
I like you too.
I gotta piss.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
No rust?
Too old.
Me too.
What's suck night?
I don't know nothing about it.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
I work alone.
Right.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Hmmm?
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
I never felt better.
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Go ahead.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Five, maybe six.
What one?
Just better.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
For how long?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
I just had a mental picture of...
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Oh, I could die...
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Doing what?
How long would you need me?
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Name it.
A wife?
Sure.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Wow.
Uh...yeah.
That's boring!
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Good-bye!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
But, Eve, I would--
Thanks.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Your mom made that all by herself.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
I'll try.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Yes, sir. It's true.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
1959.
Yeah?
True.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Bye, Adam!
My father is a genius.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old do I look?
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Good!
Are you in trouble, son?!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Yes, dear!
To go up.
All our friends...
Would you like a tranquilizer?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
If I...you know...
What?
Well, we did in my family!
Yes...
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
I don't believe it!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
What are you doing here?
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
I knew you'd like him.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, yes.
Oh, my God...
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Well, that's blunt!
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Always good advice.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Yes, you do.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He didn't leave with them.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
We'll find him.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
What?!
Come on.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Only you and the photo lab.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Well.
I, I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
No, please. I won't.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I'm doing it.
Kiss me.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Don? Where is he?
Oh he forced you, huh?
My bourbon.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Nothing.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Hey Jeff.
Terrible boring.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I don't know.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Why not?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Okay, okay. Bye.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Okay, Sandy.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Yeah.
No.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
Go ahead!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Aye.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Connor, is that you?
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Fuck!
Ass!
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
...so that which is good may flourish
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Just like on TV.
Yes, we are.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
No way they could have seen it?
What?
Sweet-n-low!
We promise.
I'll be back at 9:00.
Hey Murph.
Y'know it is, a bit.
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
He says. This is he.
Would they do that?
She's an attractive older woman.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
That sets it off.
Hang on a second.
Nothing. Go ahead.
We know there's another stocker.
What do you think?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
I don't want to use it.
Look at the treads on those.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Sure.
On the left.
As long as he gets out OK.
Where was it parked?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Would of been nice.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I don't think we can do that.
I know.
Let me feel that.
He seems pretty good.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Eleven fifteen.
I don't think you will.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Yes. I do.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I don't know.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
You're kidding.
Take a deep breath.
Yes, he did.
Me?
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Let them fight.
Yeah. He said that.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Is that OK?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
No.
Uh-uh.
Is that Buckethead?
That's your friend Anthony?
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
Not even for emergencies?
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
His name was Swifty?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
No. I was calm.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
What is it?
Bullshit.
That's OK.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I'm trying.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Where's that guy going?
She is a good looking woman.
You Hoto?
Good to know you, John.
There was a mistake.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
...this is Conklin's computer.
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
'Why' would be enough for me.
The sooner the better.
Then what?
Conklin.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I should be better by now.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
What is this, a game?
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
I want to come in.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
What's that?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
And the Germans can't match it?
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What? The tapes?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
You mean, did I want a date?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Wallace's followers.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Fourteen? --
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
I will not.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
It matters not, he is thy king!
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Nor I!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
...Tonight!
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
Exactly.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
But you must have something to go on?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Yes.
Where are my goddamn books?
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Hi, Lenny.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Of course.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
So it didn't feel... weird?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
Like how?
He's a fucking maniac!
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
We'll find out soon enough.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I thought I was the bad guy!
You're such a retard!
No.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Oh, yes, please.
Well?
No thanks, Carl.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
We said "no questions."
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
You can believe that if you want to.
Please.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Everything is quite all right.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
He suggested I ask you.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
You're saying this only to make me go.
Thank you. I try.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Go ahead.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Thank you.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Yes. What is it you want?
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Yes.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Good day.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Mademoiselle.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
He'll take one.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Excuse me.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
-- Thanks. I will.
Yeah? Why?
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Put that gun down.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Our expenses?
-- Sacha, call a cab.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
No.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Feels so good to lie here.
Fix raft first.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
As much as anybody.
Okay.  Sure.
Well, not really, I --
Had a package to deliver.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
He's your cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
Could you watch Jango?
I can't take him to work.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
My epitaph.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Let's eat.
So did I.
Don't you even think about it.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
What's going on down there?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
But I might not have.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
Hallelujah.
Deep, real deep.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Life is waiting.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Dr. Homer Wells.
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Good night, Daddy.
Two.
Sure... I'll see you around.
Okay...
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Right.
It will be okay.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Nothing.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
I never said they were boring.
Well, they aren't.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
I know what you've been doing.
They wanted a girl.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
I don't remember.
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Right.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Right?
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
When will he be home, Major?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
What view?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
She took off in the night!
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Everything looks in order.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Just the last three weeks.
Isn't it always?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
It's not true.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
Mob?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Let's go, Jake?
Jake, I mean, come on --
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
We'll use the Euc.
That's it.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
No. Just confidence.
I think two million.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Sounds respectable.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
Miles...
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
What?
Good point.
Where the hell is she?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Escorts!
Jake? Customs?
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
It's not history.
A Fed? Is he close?
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
I can imagine.
I despise the job.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
A couple I know are getting married.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I want a job, Giles.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Habib?
You mean I won't resist them.
I. sold the car.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
You've got such beautiful hands.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Leave it.
I hope it brings you luck.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I want to buy a car.
So why did you come to my casino?
You choose.
Robbery's not criminal?
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
It won't.
Wait a minute...
Yes.
Who...
Have I?
Thanks.
How long have you worked at the casino?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
You're talking about complicity.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Good call. Help yourself.
They've been tested.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
How?
Very impressive.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Oh. What's wrong now?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Yoo hoo, bomb...
All right, then...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Energy shielding positive function.
Hello, bomb.
Hey, bomb.
And I saw that I was alone.
Of course.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
That is correct.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Which one?
Who cares?
-- Remark.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Not now!
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
No kidding?
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Phenomenology...
No?
Yeah, sure, I understand.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
That's not why we're here.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I don't get involved with guns.
Yech...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Can you help me get her back?
I don't want to move away.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
The one you're wearing?
Wasn't that hard.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
Yes on all counts.
The other ones?
You did go through my stuff.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Any idea when she'll be back?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Then what?
Nothing on Hannah?
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
You're crazy.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
How long you and me known each other?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Where?
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Pull the cash.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
You're the best, Maxie.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Tell everybody hey.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
But I'll take a rain check...
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
I'm a toy to her.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
More than anything in the world.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
What? That's disgusting!
You got in the car, didn't you?
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Oh, yeah...?
What's gone?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Check.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Uhh... nothing.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
What?
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Hello summer detention.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Not if I shoot first!
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
You'll know soon enough.
You have to do something for me first.
I am so sorry.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
I'm going home.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
With, like, images?
And what?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Where are we going?
Who's Frank?
Yeah...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Why should we care?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
He said to follow him.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
I think about girls a lot.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
I... I was playing with fire.
If God exists?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Where is he, Donald?
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
What I think is going on with your son.
Come again?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
But now you can't go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Go back to China, bitch!
I stole four beers from my dad.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Oh-yah.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Loretta, never have kids.
Thank God for bunge cords.
This came for you, sweetie.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Your parents'd kill you.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
What?!
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
You heard me. Where is it?
Bitch!
Here, have some.
Yeah...
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Yeah.
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Tammy Curry?
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Yeah.
We need more bars!
Enid ate a whole pan!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
And everything.  He should be king!
The king can do no wrong! 
The king can do to wrong! 
"My dear"...
About - thirty-four seconds.
Take a letter...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
I don't call him, I whistle.
He only weighs ten ounces --
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Did you shoot the rapids?
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Go ahead.
And Vera niece, too.
You worm!
I don't remember.
No, that wasn't it...
I still like UPSTART the best.
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Yes please, two.
How lovely.
I've always thought that myself.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
No, I think a whiskey.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Well, these things take time.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Hmmm?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Yes?
I'll show you! I'll show you!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
Right... Right.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
...Yes, Sir.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Well, yes.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Oh no?
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
Oh, yes.
Thank you... very much.
...I learned a long time ago.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Oh yes.
Good morning.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
I've heard.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Ah! It's my father!
Who, Father?
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
Yes.
"The fifth one this week"!
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Of course.
I shouldn't have come.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
I'm sure it's lovely.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Yes?
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
What -- rape?
What?
About raping me?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Ah.
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
That's my boy!
Sorry!
Make your mind up.
Look out!
Well, come on!
I've got you!
Who gets killed?
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Keitel Blacksmith?
How about making friends?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
She MUST have a knife or something...
You will wait?
Please.
What do we have to do?
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
What have you got there?
Can't make enough swords!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
That's right.
How can we stops him now?
Like you got rid of Snorri!
But it's a responsibility...
Sh!
Helpless...
Dad!
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Yes, Mother.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
You did? You liked me?
Okay, I guess.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
I like to read.
What?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
No, not at all.
I think so.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You'll call me, right?
It's three.
You're not ready.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
No. Thanks.
Yeah, Tangerine?
No.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
What do you mean?
Really? Is he cute?
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Is that what you want?
Okay.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I think she's great.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I think we should go.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Tomorrow?
Oh, um...
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Guess what I'm wearing.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I'm like a joke to them.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Nah, I don't know.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Where?
Do you swear you didn't know?
How did I look?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Hi.
Nothing.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Welcome, Howard.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Alexander Pope?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
It was a mutual decision.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
She came to help, Howard.
Oh dear.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
This one's history. Moving on...
Patrick, we need to focus.
Jesus, Patrick!
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
It's a quote book.
I know who you are.
Save your breath for the climb.
Clockworks.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Easy come, easy go.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I was a successful model once.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Your ranch?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
I heard it.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
No, he didn't.
"Another man?" Who?
No.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Nothing. It's nothing.
Pressure?
He's crashing...
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
Yes, sir!
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
...you okay?
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
That is not acceptable --
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
I don't know...
I'm not the Devil.
Something like that, yeah.
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
What is it, Smith?
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Keep your eyes open.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
No. It was someone else.
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
There's no one here.
Can you shut it down?
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
We're losing atmosphere...
Picking up magnetic interference.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
It wants me. I have to go.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Relax, it's casual.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
And you can? Power it up?
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Youthful high spirits.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Ben. Are you okay?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Got it, teach.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Not this again --
Ben! Ben!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
But all these people...
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Please tell me you go silent too.
Okay, "mom."
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
Yes, thanks.
Passion.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
And reverse the mutations --
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Why didn't you say something?
You need a doctor.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Sure.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Of course.
Don't worry about it.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
First door on your left!
Later.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Why can't you do it?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Well... it's true.
I didn't say that.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Ugh.
Dad says!
Nice to meet you.
Oh, really?
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Mark is a really nice boy...
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
All right, I take it back.
We've got to get an abortion?
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
No.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Yeah?
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
All right. Pay attention.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I'm really pretty busy...
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
How often do you go?
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
That's me, Merv.
Totally.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Just be glad you're all right.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
What should I do?
There's nothing to it.
It was okay.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I think they're both virgins.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
He's not coming.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know. I guess so.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
How about your phone number?
Thanks. So do you.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
What about those other guys you live with?
Yes.
I've heard that, too.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Righto!
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
A major!
Las Vegas.
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
My heart!
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
He told me he was turning in early...
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Part of what?
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
They'll be back.
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Where is everyone?
Her fella.
But it's got teeth.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And the rest of 'em?
And the head?
Hey!
There's a tunnel.
Follow me.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Just move!
Just an observation.
We lived near power lines.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
Well...
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
How much I got, what?
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
What?
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Two.
Seven.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Clear!
Gimme the keys.
Move slow and move quiet.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Whoa!
That's one piece of four problems.
I said I'm not lying.
Putting on my armor.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Thank you.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Who is she?
I know, but --
Right now we have to be practical.
He knows, Frances.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Sort of.
Who?
...Yes.
No?
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
Thank you.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
Thanks, Dad.
I know.
Always. Always.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Please, Francie...
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah, well --
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Enh.
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
Quietly.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
I took the early rounds.
What?
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
I love you too, Frances.
Oh Harry...
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Well... you're looking well.
I'm not sure.
Yes.
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Yes, Ma.
Mama, what's...
What's wrong?
I'll be back.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Mama...?
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Excuse me.
Don't I know you?
I see.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Sedate her.
What?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
You speak.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
I see it before me.
Materials. Nothing more.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
There, there... shhh...
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I wish to be your husband.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Open this door for no-one!
As a march hare.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Can you think of a better reason?
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
It's a letter to my father.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Artist.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
I don't know.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I'll go take a look.
Wet. I don't know.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I can't, Barry...
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
I don't love Neddy.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I call it my shower dream.
Mmmmmmmph.
Rocky Road.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Sure.
Another coincidence.
Just my son and I.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Have you ever been there before?
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
The truth hurts.
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
He's running the show.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Jacob.
He's my son.
On the dresser.
Come again?
Scott and Kate.
Yes, she is.
Auto wreck.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Yes, they do.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Okay.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Anytime.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Whatsamatter?
I wasn't scratching!
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
No.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
We are?
They broke when you fell.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Okay, I'll have one.
Yeah, it's mine.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Didn't take long.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Across the board, sir.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
I'll act surprised.
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Yes, dear.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Absolutely not.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
No, ma'am.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
This has nothing to do with you.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
Me?  Why me?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
What?
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Whose orders were those?
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
Educate her, Pyro.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
15, sir.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
O'Neil, Jordan.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Great. See ya then.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
Most people don't.
Sure. I'd like that.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
I got pretty close.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Who is he?
What's it to you?
What do I get?
Five bucks.
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Not now. You got my bag?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Have them sealed off.
It's Tatopoulos.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
That's right.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
Are you sure? How do you know?
It's okay. I know her.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
You go first! There's no time!
Nothing.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Yes. Good was done this .....
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
I played Richard III...
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
No I didn't.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
It's okay. Listen-
Yes Commander?
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
The enemy is matching velocity.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Only answers to me.
Tell them? About...
Jason..
JASON...
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Gwen...
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
You can oc that?
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
The army can survive without me.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
That can't be.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Lafayette will not be happy...
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Delighted, sir.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
To learn to shoot cannon?
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
No one knows...
But it's more than just that, am I right?
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
You invented this, this...
George!  So good to be back!
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
The man is a traitor!
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I want you to see our hospital.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
I think I will disappoint you.
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Farrah. Come here.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
That's right, me.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Gimme an hour.
What?
It's a different kind of deal.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
That's correct. Look at me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
He owes me money.
Not yet. I just started.
Where you been, Harry?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Fuckin' basketball game.
So you don't work for the casino?
Not really.
Once.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
So what's the problem?
Let's see how we get along.
Read it. It's a grabber.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You're kidding, right?
Never say anything unless you have to.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Martin, look at me.
I believe it.
They report it to the IRS.
Sit down, Leo.
I know what a vig is.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
...That's what we finally decided.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Man, can you scream.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Right. See how your story ends.
Sounds fair.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
You're as bad as Harry...
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
You seem to feel fine about it.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Oh, yeah, sure.
'We?'
And after all, you have such morals.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Sixty pounds.
That's what it says.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Maureen?
Roger?
Seen a lota movies.
Oh yeah.
Right. Wednesday.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Yeah, yeah.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
It looks like it.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Not me.
You smashed it!
If money can buy what he wants.
Right.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Because of the gold.
Better than starving to death.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
You're more practical than superstitious.
There's somebody else on this boat.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
What?
If it was a ship she hit.
Victims of what?
That much I think we've already established.
What's that supposed to mean?
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
I think I see it pretty well.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
Looks like it's adrift.
Yeah.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Fifteen, at the most.
Who?
God, how horrifying.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
I just buzzed him in.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
I guess.
What?
How perfect.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
We should follow them!
Okay, okay!
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
Oh yeah.
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
We should follow him home.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Bingo!
Oh yeah...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Everybody's too stupid!
Where did you get that?
Where?
You cunt!
He does that every single day.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
I don't believe you.
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
I need to talk to you.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Shhh!
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
It's kind of falling apart.
You're late, asshole.
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
What?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Jesus!
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
C'mon, Seymour, please?
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Just wait here.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Hooray for me.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Are you okay?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Why?
Who knows?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
How can you be so sure?
What? You're kidding me...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
I dunno, I...
I-I-I...
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
Yeah.
I am.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why? What did she tell you?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Yes?
Don't they, though?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Have you got that in writing? 
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
Might be exciting for you.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
John, it will not be easy.
You mean nobody died?
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
That's very considerate.
But of course yours worked.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Once... 
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
Four should do it.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
We don't have a relationship.
How is he these days?
Does he ever mention me?
Okay, that's no problem.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
I'll supervise.
Oh, hello, Peter.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Now you're talking.
What are you doing up here?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Okay.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Who are they?
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Get on with it, counselor!
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Hello, Venkman.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
I'm Peter --
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
I'll get one more reading.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
I hate Jello.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
I'm ready.
Huh?  What?
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
No.  They're just coming to me.
Eight o'clock?
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
It's in the stars.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
That's a violin concerto.
Well, let's check it out.
I told you, I ...
Are you all right?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
All right.  What do you want to do?
Then leave.
You heard it?
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Really!  Is it gone?
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
I think it's the food of the future.
Thank you.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
You could say that.
I'm not at liberty to say.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Yeah, I can smell it.
What do you mean "bad?"
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Gozer.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Life is just a state of mind.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
That appears to be the case.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
To go into business for ourselves.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
No sense worrying about it now.
Where are you, Pete?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
It's not good, Pete.
I don't think it's Shandor.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
And the seas would boil ...
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
I'm sure, I don't know.
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Gladly Caesar.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
You're hearing about somebody else.
You don't know how wrong you are.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
What deal?
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Greeks?
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I killed too many barbarians.
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Yes.
Yes.
No.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No.
But, Elaine --
I just want to tell you something.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
You sure you really want to?
Get out of here.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Here he comes.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
If you want.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
What?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Yes.
No, Benjamin.
Thank you.
Mr. McQuire.
Yes, sir.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What?
Because I don't like you.
I want you out of here.
Yes.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Will you bring it in to me?
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
That's right.
What for?
But it's light in there now.
What?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
I know that. But I'm --
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Oh my God.
I've got to go.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Waiter!
I haven't. No.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Benjamin.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
What?
Either one will be fine.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Are you kidding?
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.
INADEQUATE!
Are you tired of it?
There!
I walk out.
He's asleep.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Calm down, Benjamin.
No.
No.
Don't tell Elaine.
What?
Yes.
Art.
Kind of.
How do you think.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Then let's hear them.
I see.
Now don't start this.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Go home now.
Where is Elaine?
I'll find her.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
About an hour ago.
About what?
What about it?
No.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
Ben -- how old are you now?
I'd like to hear it.
I will.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Well?
No --
You can't.
You're a fool!
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Very little.
Aren't you?
Free --
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Yes --
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Am I quite strange to you?
Yes -- I do understand.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
I don't want them now.
I know.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
For Vienna?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
We could come to my room.
You've lost everything?
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Be quiet.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
No, Doctor.
Send his bags up to my room.
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
Stay where you are.
No.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
I never danced before -- in public.
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Moreover --
Perhaps. 
Definitely off.
Well?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
You think so?
Exactly.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
What -- what is it? Last night...
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Me?
-- We must do something...
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Well -- gentlemen.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
I'll loan you a raincoat.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
It's not your fault.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
You must have some money.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Not very good!
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
This time...
Scram. Go home.
Taking you for granite?
Are you sure?
Mm?
All? It ain't bad.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Because it's comfortable.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Where?
Upstate where?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Sure.
Open it and find out.
) What?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
No question, huh?
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Doesn't look good.
I think someone broke into my house.
Checking out your place.
Nothing's missing?
My office?
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Will, sit down...
I was trying to get away from someone.
Yes.
I don't know.
Just get on the bus.
John, you can't help her now.
Please, get on the bus...
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I came to see you.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
It's not going to happen.
He's my brother.
Are you going to leave, too?
Oh, right.  Sorry.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Where's Shane?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Then they can watch.
The voice man!  He's here!
But I've seen him!
Okay ... But just for tonight.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
It's a rune ... Thorn.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
But surely Rogers isn't --
It's a sign.  He's come home.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
This is madness, Wynn.
It was you.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Stay away, Sam.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
How all the magazines show tits today.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least!
This room is full of ghosts.
Go home!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Go home!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
You know me, boy.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Maybe it's time you got out.
Everybody thinks that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
If what?
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
The posies are for her?
I've considered that.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
Thank God!
I'll see.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
They were in the same creative writing class.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
Mhravitch.
I don't know.
Go on.
Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Sir?
Can't it keep till morning?
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Leave a tip.
Nothing.
No.
Daughter--I love you very much.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Give us time.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Nothing would please me more.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Ram it up your ass!
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Yes.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Sounds quite beautiful.
I plan to live one hundred years!
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
It's always locked.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Yes.
Correct.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Comical?
King Arthur.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
If you want to be found that way.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
You don't know?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Ja?
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's alive!
Still lives with his mother.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
That's something I suppose.
I know.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
A what?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
You're saying no.
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
Take plenty of cigars.
Tonight's the night.
Paul's only twelve years old.
Goodbye.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
He died of a massive rupture.
It's good.  Let him go.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Yes, we do.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
What are you doing?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Well, I want to...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Yeah.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Huh?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
A friend.
'Sucking off.'
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
But what?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Who's paying you?
And better?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Yeah.
Do you think she's safe?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out!
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
How did you find me?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Well...
Okay.
Who?
Ratan!
What exactly do you have in mind?
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
You never heard of that?
Oh.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
No.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Hello.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Where are the papers?
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
No, thank you. I have my car.
What?
Oh.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Promise?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Because they are all the same.
Is he all right?
What is that he's working on?
No more revolts.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Well, why don't you?
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Where's that?
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Yes. They're old friends.
Maude.
Here.
I took them out.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
But why now?
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
I don't know.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Jeez! That's a great story,
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
ZAT!
Eh?
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh yes. That's fine.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
I know.
It certainly is.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
What's the matter with her?
So you slept O.K.?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
It's been Hell.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
The Cenobites.
Is he serious??
Story of my life.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
See? I don't like that --
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
No. I never was.
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Coffee's warming me up.
What?
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
What's the problem?
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
We're leaving.
Sure.
Julia's my second wife.
You did this before, right?
It's important.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
I don't want to see the dress.
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
I don't.
Hi. I got soaked.
Where's Daddy?
Oh my God.
Ah!
The best part of ten years.
Why not?
I cut myself.
Are you O.K.?
I'm here.
Sure.
I've seen worse.
No. I'll do it.
Please...
Please. I can't bear it...
Just soda.
No.
We don't need a bed, do we?
Wait a moment --
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
YOU'D like my room.
You will keep in touch.
Is Julia here?
Sure.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Really?
I don't believe it.
Oh no.
Your father told me you were working here.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Sure. Why not?
Really.
I beg your pardon?
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
What's next?
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
But now I kind of like it.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Ehh.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
How do you know about that?
What band?
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Laura.  Her dad died.
No way.
So?  You even said they're good.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
They always seemed...
Do not get ahead of yourself.
It's the new --
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
Nobody.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Yeah, sure...
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Fine.
I want a tape.
-- FUCK OFF!
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Think about it, Rob.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
You really believe that?
What, what?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Fine.  One.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I guess.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
Is that the last of it?
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Well, think about it.
Pigsty.
Pig died.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
Uh... No.
Mmnn.
C'mon.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
It'll have to be sex, then.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Want to know what, exactly?
What's the difference?
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Hi.  What are you doing?
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Fair enough.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Everything go alright?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Nor have you!
Yes.  You?
Oh, right.  Alright.
How's the store?
Well call her mother.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Well we don't.
This one came unassembled.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Claymore.
The boy _died_?
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
That bothers you?
You had to do _nothing_!
You're a fool.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
Yes.
At least.
You won't.
Of bodies.
You killed those other two.
Come here, Brenna.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Will I see you again?
You have lived forever.
Now there's a new topic.
What are you getting at, Moran?
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
Pheasant.
You're a long way from Inverness.
You know me home.  Me name.
I don't know why.
This is madness!
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
You will live.  Survive.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Me arm hurts.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
I am not ready for this.
Of course.
But I did live.
Far away.
Certainly not me.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Finish yours?
We need more time.
Mulet.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
If you wish to play games, Major.
Thanks.
Where did you learn that?
I don't know.
And the Bulgarian?
Head still secure to the neck.
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
He always did.
I've had a few more concerns.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
This isn't done.  Get up.
Leave her alone.
American.
Do you?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
When may I expect the cleaners?
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Yes, wasn't it?
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Thank you.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
So long.
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Just what I said. That's what I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
You -- you --
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Now you got me.
No kidding?
What for?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
I know, but --
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
All right, Walter.
Was she? Did you notice?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Come here. See if we can move it.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Murder, uh?
Who did you talk to?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Walter!
What's the matter with my brains?
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I'm busy, Duffy.
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I think it is.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Yes, sir.
Three bullets! Any good?
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
I'll have it in a minute.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
I can't.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Don't move!
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Ssh!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Forty dollars.
The what?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Hello, Mollie.
Come on, fellas.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Looking for shrapnel.
What's that?
I only know one.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
He's the worst liar.
I'm starting my own collection.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
A bit too quick.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Please yourself.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Kiss me Hardy.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
I will if you will!
And absent bridegrooms!
Oh, that.
Fair enough.  The river.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
Wasn't it lovely?
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
You might still have a house.
Father, that's enough now
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
Really, that's a long time.
Yikes.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
What?
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Baby! Stop!
No, I told you...
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Yeah, come on.
You're welcome.
Whoopie fucking doo.
You know... a couple of queers.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Hey, wait take this.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
I don't drive cross country.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
What's that?
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
There's not enough room.
What!
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
I gotta open the gate.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
I don't want to see that.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Shhhhhh.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Tell me about it.
She looks like she stinks.
I can't believe...
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I don't know... about half an hour.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
You said it, not me.
Enough with the stupid voices.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
Who's your Daddy!
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Yes, sir.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I always favored the Hulk.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
We found one.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
That is the wrong fork, young man.
And think about what you've done.
It's embarrassing, okay?
French?
Oui. Perfect!
Of course not.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
That would be good.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Not in front of the boy.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
I just want to talk.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
No!
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Always. Ow.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Please, honey, let me in.
Oh, Rosie.
You've got to respect that.
Paper or cloth?
I'm not sure.
We are animals after all.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
I don't think so.  Why?
Of course.
That's very funny.
A deer?
What?
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
That's great.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Such as what womanly things?
That was wonderful!
Absolutely!
Ummm. It's good.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Oook. Oook.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Got it.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
No.
Right.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
You know what's good for him?
Thank you.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Cut.
Yeah? Why?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
I got drunk.
In that case, you owe me another drink.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
You think I can lose?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Well, I win sometimes.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
I said we're leavin'.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Aaaahhhh!
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
I don't want it.
Fast and loose, man.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Aw, Eddie.
Shoot.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
What?
Fine, thanks.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I used to be an actress.
I'm not.
I drink.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
What's it so hot in here for?
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
You watch me.
No.
You lived like this once.
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
What?
Who?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
Please.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
What did it look like?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
It's really nice of you to help us.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I take it you've heard.
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
Did it work?
Punched the President? Oh my god.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
So sue me.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
Haven't you been watching?
That signal. It's a countdown.
Dad, don't start.
Three years.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
You as well.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Then find them.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
Roger.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
Butt-munch.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
You know me...
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
It's all fuzzy.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
Air... water... your "sun."
Die.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
You've got it!
Yes. My treat.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
How dare he?!
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
I usually don't.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Are you sure?
Mine, too.
Where is it? I want it.
All I have to do is scream.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Head for the fireplace!
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
And do I detect a rebuke?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Thanks.
It happens to me all the time.
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
Penitent. Penitent...
We named the dog Indiana.
Who are you?
Come on -- come on!
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
You should have been there...
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Step on it, Short Round!
Okay, Shorty.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Why?
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
What?
Two are still missing.
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Oh yeah?
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
Their children?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
First of all -- don't panic!
What?!
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
Willie!
Quiet!
I'm going down.
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
There's got to be another way out.
Not quite.
You got it!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
I know you did!
Who's you?
Where are we?
You said it.
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
Yeah.
With a man in my head...
Outrun them.
No. Don't tell the guards.
I am. You are.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
Take a left and your next right.
What am I supposed to do?
Little late for that.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
Try another language.
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
Who, me?
What glasses.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
I don't know what's going on.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
This just won't work.
Osaka?
Just stay here and rest.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
I told you, I have a feeling...
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Don't worry!
Drink lots of water.
A hard left. A hard left.
You were with GRUNER!
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
That's nice.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Do what? What'd you do?
Dieter?
Don't worry.
Then how did you know?
**?!! 
I have a new client.
Oh.
Who...are you?
Well what?
Oh yeah, thanks...
Not you. Them.
I don't know Who.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Yessir...very good sir.
No. No one to speak of.
Where?
Oh...I can't. Business.
Without what?
Like there's someone else here.
That you're not crazy.
You're talking to me.
How often they come here?
You seemed interesting.
There's not much to tell.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Last night?
No, he didn't do that.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
He must be a good friend.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
I asked him.
Can you?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
That I really don't know.
What?
You're gonna laugh.
Her?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
It was you.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Why not?
Just one. The back up.
It'l be alright.
It doesn't hurt.
What does he know?
Whoever took it does.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Instant rice...?
Lowell?
I'll be there.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Good.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
What about you, you got a crew already?
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
How are you, Jim?
Call me back in ten.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Don't you have to be at the office?
Try the car.
Soy sauce...
That's my stuff from the office...
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Hello? Yeah...
I'm alone on this...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
...you fucked me!
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
What?
What?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Everything interests me.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
Far as you go where?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
If you want to do it.
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
No.
You believe that?
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
Yeah, great.
No.
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Liane has filed for divorce...
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Chapter and verse.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Well, I wouldn't say --
Here. Got pictures.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Howard!
Mr. Dumbarton.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Asian? No.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
What?
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
You don't believe in it.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
No. Don't stop.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
She didn't love you?
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Huh?
Do you want to sleep on it?
Yes. Again.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Miles.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
May I come in?
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Hello Miles.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Forgery? Fraud?
Murder?
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Jesus.
Oh, God!
I'm dying.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
I guess.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
We've outlined a settlement...
Thank you.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Mm.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Video.
I am very sorry.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
HA!
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Mother?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Muriel Rumsey.
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
The reward.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Why? Do you know him? 
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Lower the boats!
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Sock her!
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
But it's King Westley on the phone.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Are you talking to me?
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Yes.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
I can't go out like this.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Yeah?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
What are you talking about?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Next week "East Lynne."
I refuse to resign!
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
know—but—
I don't want it now.
What?
Try me.
Doesn't sound very exciting.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
I hate the horrid stuff.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Amazing.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Mind your own business.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
You bet I did.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Come here, you little fool!
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Bridge washed out—around Dawson.
Yes.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Well, I'll be—
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Yeah.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is—"  No, do you really?
Who?
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Zeke.  Git!
Hey, you!
Why—no—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Yeah. Just babies.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Keep saying what?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
I see.  And where did you drive?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
A Perry Russo?
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
It's going to get worse, honey.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Huh?
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
What are you driving at, boss?
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Allen Dulles?
They're gonna love you, chief.
We need him back.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...and your General?
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Six.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Not a problem.
I understand.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
I found out.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
I'm not saying another word.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
What's in it?
Who do you think I am?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Sure.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Cash poor?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
I don't care.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
Right around here, in the food court.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
That's my job.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
Do you think they bought it?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Set him up.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
What the fuck is that shit?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
You talk to him?
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
But you didn't do that.
Great...  ...Wanda!
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Dreaming.
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Sure.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
They told me.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
Who?
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
What the hell you talkin' bout?
How do you know she did that?
Man, I don't like that part.
She don't know shit about the money.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
We had done time together already.
No.
I don't like dancing.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Who's arm is that?
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Uh-huh?
And your point is?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
This one.
Are you serious?
That's good money.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
What do I do?
I'm in my underwear.
That was Beaumont.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I shot her.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Pretty sure.
You said five hundred and fifty!
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
We went to the parking lot.
It's in there.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
What?
How am I supposed to know that?
Watcha gonna see?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You think you could do that?
Livingston, huh?
House.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
I got some more business for ya.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
Git your ass in here.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
Winston found you.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
And where's Jackie?
I was gonna tell you...
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
No, thanks.
I'm okay.
How do you know?
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
That's right. We did.
There's nothing to expose.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Now what?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
You should go back to her.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Wiggle your toes.
I don't know what to say.
But I see them.
Hell, you think I am?
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
I didn't want to wake you.
Thanks.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
I don't know.
No. The little one.
I don't let anybody call me that.
A good lay.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
They're like demons, Jez.
Show me Della!
It's gone to the top.
Get your clothes off.
What kind of man are you?
Why didn't you call me?
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
I'm not upset.
Don't be funny.
Sit down, Jake.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Long time ago.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
Well that's good to know.
They're awfully heavy.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Hot. Where do I sign?
I'm awake?
A long time.
I work in a bakery.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's goin' on Paul?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
Why not?
I don't know what to do.
You've seen them?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Died?
How did it happen?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Pour it in.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
We don't have a choice!
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Get out of here!
What?!
Where'd you get the gun?
Two more charges to go.
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
I don't know!
Suit up.
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
You got that right.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Negative.
I hope so.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
What if we don't?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
And what happend to ...?
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
I'm stuck!
No shit. I got no problem with that.
I'm on my way.
Again?! Jesus!
You lost the charge?
They'll make it.
Crutch?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Oh shit! There he is!
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Keep trying!
What?!!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Obviously so.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Get him out of there!
What have I done?! Idiots.
Exactly.
Sure but what good will that do?
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
He's taken him!
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Michael! Come inside!
Can you do that?
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Why?
My kids were on that beach...
No, we just checked the beach...
Swell.
What stinks so bad?
What do we do?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
I can't imagine why.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
What else could've done that?
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
I've got all these signs here...
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Ever see one like this?
I think I can top that, Mister...
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
I don't think so.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I totally heard you did.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Huh?
Yeah. That was me.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Why?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Is Vanessa here?
Come on, I have something for you.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
I heard that was you.
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Nothing...
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
You're pregnant?
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
You mean like couples?
Thundercats are go!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I am a suicide risk.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
It was magnificent, man!
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Or stage parents!
Share the love, Tits!
You sound shocked or something.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
They're yellow.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
Karma.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
How'd you meet Early?
You can?
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
What's Early been in jail for?
...Anything else?
Jeez... Adele!
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Early! Stop!!
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
...Then some.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Thanks. What are you doing?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
I still think we should have met them first.
I heard that.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Fuck!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Not yet.
No.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
How?
Yeah.
He lives on 76th?
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
The cartoon?
Right.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Yeah.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Hold up man.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Right now?
You have?
You were?
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
How do you know?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Do you care about me?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
No, Fidget, I...
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I guess so.
One.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Mine?
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah?
Making love is like.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
He still does.
It's me. Telly.
Nah.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
What kind of problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
Sit down!
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Who is this?
Did you know her?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Where is she?
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
Then call them!
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
He already did once.
Of course.
My cheering section.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Six, eight hours tops.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
That's great.
We're not sure.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
It's important.
Meaning?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
I got it from the tournament directory.
It doesn't make sense.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
He knows you're aware of that.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Whatever's on your mind.
No.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Yes.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Getting too hot in here for you?
I don't think I could.
Let's change the subject.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
No.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
What's wrong?
Then why are you backing up?
What?
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
Frank told me.
I'm sure you are.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Thank you, but I can wait.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Turold's son was to marry her.
You won't have to.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
What do you see?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
I chose the wrong passage.
No! You cannot know that!
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
Yes.
I ache with it.
I cannot betray my bride.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
What business?
I have need of friends.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
Not sleepy, either?
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
We must try to get horses.
Would you settle for a boar?
I am Quell.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
A small house.
No.
You can have half.
I'd wish for a puppy.
I only want one.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
You had better manners as a pig.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
We have plenty of hares.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
Yes. We lost five.
How many did you lose?
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Fewer will survive them.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
Where is he? My son.
Why must you know?
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
Why do you want to know?
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
No?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
How can you say it?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
OK.
Yes, yes...
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
Yes.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
...17.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
A little...
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Yes.
...Yes.
Mathilda, listen!
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh? Why?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
No... Dino's.
No...
Where?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Maybe later.
How serious is it?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Can it kill me?
You have?
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
You're talking to me?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Show me.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
He's plastered.
Pacifica, California.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Not our problem.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
You tell stories?
That's me.
Nine.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Maybe.
You're amazing.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Tomorrow.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
Why know?
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Steph.
Someone should be with you.
Forty-seven years.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
It's yours.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
No -- S.E.R.A.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
To death?
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Sorry.
OK.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Be careful.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Can we just ignore it?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
That's right.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Go to hell.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
That's not what's important.
Who could better understand than me?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
How?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
No. I was in the shower.
I guess.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Because they got wet.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Thank you!
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
-- uh --
Aristotle.
I don't know.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
That's terrible!
No.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Relation?
Yes, he is.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Margot!
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
She's completely untrustworthy.
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Your what?
So are you!
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
See?
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Faith.
Then we smash 'em?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Purely a precaution...
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
Grotesque... monstrous...
Not from me, surely...
I am afraid of nothing.
Do it now!
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
What do you want from me?
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
It would appear so.
Careful, lad.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Blackheart?
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
There's the way, mates.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Will you chance a miss?
That's it!
Fire away!
It doesn't matter.
Mean you to seek him out below?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Go on... go on...
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
If you like.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
I'll go search for it.
I'm not its master.
Are you honest?
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
My father and the Baron.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Oh, la...
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
You've freed me, Jack...
In the dark... where I join him...
Lili... I love you!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Ask away, sweet man.
She's dead!
You'll visit again?
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
Only that?
Do I not please you, Jack?
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
You... you... you mortal you!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Oh, but I have.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
He was there and then he wasn't!
Since seventh grade.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
It's so beautiful.
I would have anyway.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
And why was the alarm on?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
Why?
I don't want you to!
I'm not gay.
Not if what he left me was real.
Will he talk to me?
It could have been a squirt gun.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
A sink?
I flushed it down the toilet.
how much weight have you lost?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
For everything.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
She didn't really say.
Thank you.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
No I'm not!
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You don't have a choice.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
Oh, okay.
I might have a solution.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
What's wrong with your back?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I can die trying.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Thanks for telling me.
Three.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Why would they tow your truck?
Money?
I want him with me.
What?
What have you been before today?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
My stupid back.
This was my very first slow dance.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
You bit my finger.
Not a perfect day.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Should I?
We should take a vacation.
Sooner than the Fall.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Do you like red?
I just thought it would be nice.
Can we really help build a house?
Someone stop her!
Better make it a week.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Take care of me?
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
You went to Monroe?
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
A loan officer?
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Oooh...
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
He's dead.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
I said you're soft.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Whatever.
Make 'em throw strikes.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
I'm not working on a plan.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Go where, Ray?
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Why the hell not?
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
I try to moisturize regularly.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Just like Elvis.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
It'll be too late.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
You shouldn't have come here.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
An angel?
Angels don't get any older, son.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
It would be so okay.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
I think you're looking at him.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
How bad?
Beast.
I know, your wickedness.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
The Dark Prince is here.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Are you dead?
What are you doing?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
East Rutherford.
I have to, Valerie.
That was Cassius!
A black guy?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
I'm in my party mood.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
Did you?
I'm fine...  See you...
It has nothing to do with you.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
I'm very smart.
Please... No.
No.  Just no.
No.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
No.
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
Not about that.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Then it's still no.
You know.
I'm going to run.
You know something.
A Runner gave it to me.
What do you need?
That's nice.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
Some people say children need human mothering.
I have.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
He's good, isn't he?
It's the only way.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I don't know.
Where are you going?
Hello.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
For as long as I can remember.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
I have always been here...
Gracious... no.
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Alive?
Yes...
Oh my... I'll try.
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
What?
Yes, I thought my wife...
What is?
Maid? Relative?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Right... This just glided along.
Or not so recently?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Yeah, I remember.
Me, too.
I used to.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
We killed him.
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
What's the word on the street?
Pete, what happened to you?
Nothin'.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Not even close.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
My... My head.
No, no. I want to go in.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Alice who?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
What job?
Was there?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Yeah.
We just killed a couple of people...
Yeah?...
It was weird...
I don't want to talk about it...
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Thank you.
Fossils.
A paleontologist.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
That's ridiculous.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Come on, Lovey.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
I'll say.
Gold. You were going to—
All right.
No.
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Over by that hill.
Well - I'm—
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
How do you do?
Thank you.
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
That's intelligent.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Yes.
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Do you think this will come in my time?
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
Oh, George . . .
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Why not?
You're wrong, George.
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
What if he refuses?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
I wonder.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
You see, it's not a dream.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Why?
I'd love it!
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
English!
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Please don't go.
Perhaps.
I gotta be honest about something.
And if I say yes?
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
Well this didn't.
Actually, sir--
I'd go with number three.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
What?
So what's the problem?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
She didn't even know you. .
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
The Pentagon.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Actually, you may have.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
They're not my pals--
Will it lower the curve?
Scientific American?  Really?
May I have a look?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Agatha...
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
That's comforting.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
... Graveyard shift.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Lara --
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
What?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Everybody runs.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
You're kidding, that's today?
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Run the subscription list...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Did he close the front door?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Yes, it is.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Do I know you?  Who are you?
They don't belong to anybody.
Uh, I'll try...
Wanna hear something funny?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Some -- somebody's father?
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
No.
Who said I would?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
I'm a little dizzy...
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I thought you were retiring?
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
I wanna kill my boss.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
There's thousands of units like this one.
We can stop him.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
But John was with him at the pool?
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No thank you.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
What if I gave you forty?
Manhattan.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Ho's a good guy --
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Draw.
She'll be out in a minute.
Yeah. Where is he?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Ricky's taken care of.
Where's Ricky.
That's why they call it the smart money.
No.
Yeah.
He'll work it off.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
What drill?
Good morning.
Where's the drop?
Traveling light. I like that.
Soho.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
It's not losing record.
Don't be shitty.
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you.
I thought you hate that club.
Shhh...
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
We don't need guns.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
It's not even yours.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
I don't know.
What did I 'get?'
Like I said, I don't know.
You got that right.
We're getting whacked.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
You're out of money?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Where do you get this shit?
I'll be a minute.
Bobby and Ricky.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
I didn't do anything --
Yes.
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Watch it...
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Does anyone want another?
Here...
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Soho Grand, right?
You'll love it.
No. What is it?
What?
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Bet you like that shit.
What?
Solid, daddy.
What you talking?
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
Read it and keep on reading.
Then the devil is white.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
You have enough worries of your own.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
I know.
Yes.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
What do you want me to do?
Dear heart, I love you.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I'm tired of praying.
Let some of us come down there.
That's right.
Please, go ahead.
You put it very well.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Allah Akbar.
Yes, sir, I did.
What?
Say what you're saying.
If she got eyes, she do.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
Now you come back.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
What mission?
You hear me, girl?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
The hell you are.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Yeah.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
I'm the man.
He's bright.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
I'm not... easy.
So where do we begin?
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[And?]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
If they like me.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Why not?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Time will tell.
No.
My ankle.
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
No.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Do you know what she told me last night?
For a year?
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
Don't forget your towel.
[Is that good or bad?]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
I can take care of myself.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
Oh, yeah.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I came to see you. How you feel?
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Well, it ain't your baby.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Your son Marty?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I'm having a very good time, too.
I'm thirty-four.
Thank you.
Yes, I know.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Please...
Nothing.
Nothing.
How do you do?
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Where you going now?
I'll see you around.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
You gotta good heart.
You gonna die without a son.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
I don't know. I don't think so.
She didn't look Italian to me.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
What didn't you like about her?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
What nurses?
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
How you, Radar?
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Home.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Or her figger.
What the hell's going on here?
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
Duke Forrest.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
He can't take much more time on the table.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
When?
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
C-A-M-E-M...?
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
I like an olive.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Something else we have in common.
Same here.
Ayuh.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Thanks.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Just in dreams?
You can cut the bow.
I don't think so either.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
You got me.
Hello.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Me?
No, thank you.
I guess so. Then what happened?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
Oh!
There is no letter. I made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Plus a bonus.
Sorry.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Oh!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Yeah, a little.
Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
Go out and find her!
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
. . . Tubby?
Naw.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
A gag. A gag!
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goods—a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Huh? Get what?
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Thanks.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Good night, John.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
Huh?
Am I gettin' the car?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Roper...
Sorry... Habit.
If you say so.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
National Marksman Competition.
Not the ones I'm at.
Explain how that works.
Every couple of months, huh?
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Why?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Still needs work.
The jockey!
He's cutting down the visibility.
Damnit!
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
She's the one to blame. Not me.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
You heard.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Scottie...
It's very nice.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Hmm?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Depends. What's up?
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
What do you think would be in order?
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
I want to be put on this case.
To live forever.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Wake up?!
No.
In here I am.
One would assume so.
Unfinished business.
It's his nature.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
New York.
The weather.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Go!
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
The truth.
Katie was digitized.
Try harder.
Where?
Yes.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
It was a test.
I know.
Not you.  A copy.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
This.  No point to it.
There?
Just like that?
Activated.
-- Transmit now!
Speed?
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Ah... sure.
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
THERE'S THE COMET!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
BULK!!
Look closer.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
Did I say anything?
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
LET'S DO IT!?
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
But ya got a Boss.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Why should I be?
I guess I am. Just a little.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
He was around...
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
I can just imagine.
I must be going.
I needed to see you again.
You're sure?
It's a mask.
Gives us something in common.
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
You gotta plan these things.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Not if they all die at once.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
And the Jews?
I don't fuck my partners.
They do what I tell 'em.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Okay. I'm listening.
And what do you want out of this?
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Kill them! Kill them!
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
I don't know. I guess it was...
Yeah...before your time.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Sad commentary, huh?
I didn't say anything.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Got a doctor on duty.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
The ring...
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
All right. You can come.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
... Manly?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
This way?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
You got worms.
Who?
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
And to Don Quixote!
"There's more light here," he says--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Good idea. When?
No--not offhand--
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
He's a house-afire!
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
No wonder--without your dinner.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Y-yes, Jim.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Aw--
The--head?
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
What stuff?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Mr. President!
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
For one week!
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
No.
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Will he *yield*?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
J-Jefferson Smith.
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Oh, but this one is so simple.
What's that?
*This* is.
We're over in the House.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
It *is* not!
No!
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Must have been tickled pink.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Wait--
But--I've done everything I--
Oh--Saunders--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Wonderful!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Well, well!
Okay. See you here.
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
He's lost complete faith in me--
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Who are you?
Deeds?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Who's that?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Sometimes twice.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Uh-huh.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Yes!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
What's that got to do with it?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
I enjoy it.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
What's that?
Nothing—
You have?
Are you? When?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Uh-huh.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Had the boys follow us.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yes, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
What was that you said he was?
Mr. Cedar!
Wants to know who the heir is.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Okay.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
What for?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
Why should you?
Huh?
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
No, thanks.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Shut up!
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Well, I play the tuba.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Yes?
Not at all.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Don't pay any attention to her.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Every man to his taste, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
What two policemen?
Looking for?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Yeah.
How did they threaten you?
Hmm?
One hundred books?
Uh-huh.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Ernest, what do you think?
...And I from Phyllis.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Henry!
Stop now.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
You are so mean.
Mr. Gilroy --
I do.
Oh?
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Yeah.
My patient had to leave early.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
...And?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Okay.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Sure.
That would explain it.
I'm trying.
Mumford... like the town?
Mother... go away!
What do you mean?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Something's bothering her.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Yes.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
You like it?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Either one.
I don't know if --
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I'm glad.
What was that?
Transference.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
What?
Will you wait for me?
What happened today?
Was it something that happened at school?
Do you think that's what he wants?
Really?
Is that the question?
This is exactly what I wanted.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
You don't think I'm insane?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
It's not?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Everybody has a story, Skip.
It wasn't the best situation.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Things got a lot worse.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
When?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Relax, I got him.
You're not going to kill us?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Why do you like to fight so much?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Intestines.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
To be hanged.
No.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
If you call that a kiss.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Oh that's comforting.
We're about to be shown the way.
Preparation for what?
Who was talking about what?
And what is that?
Very slowly.
Yes?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
I was mistaken.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Read the inscription on the cover!
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you knew I'd know.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Head hunting.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Do it, big boy!
I'm the Bowler.
The Inscrutable Six?
Or even what it looks like.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Doctor Heller?
He's dead.
Think positive.
You're dead.
Sure -- I guess.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
I saw him walk you home.
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Why?
Roy.
What have they got that we ain't got?
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
And you are a fool.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
LOOK!
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
See ya tomorrow.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Not yet.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
But... the silverware?
Definitely.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Sorry.
The who?
But how do we get in?
Great timing!
May the forks be with us!
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
No, thank you.
Where are they?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
I'm not insulted.
And where is Joseph?
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sire?
Let me see it.
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Ajaccio.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Four o'clock.
The first reports came in at about ten.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
Would you like some brandy?
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Yes, I am, sir.
Lisette.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
And you, Junot?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Open the door.  It's me.
What are you doing in there?
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Certainly.
What are you talking about?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
Yes, I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
My God, what do you think?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
That is correct.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
That's it?
Naw, it ain't like that.
Yeah.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
You paid cash?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Cheeco.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
That's the sister.
What you mean, so?
Okay, plan B.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
I don't.
Sorry about today, man.
I didn't see nothing.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Me too.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
I do.
All damn.
It's alright.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Have you seen Day-Day?
Smokin' what?
Excuse me?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
You damn right that's the big one.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
You could sell your Beamer.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Where's Craig?
I got fired too.
Yeah.
Keep pushing.
I don't know.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
It's an important speech.
What happened here?
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
What?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Good.
What's your point?
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Me?
That's right. That gives you...
You know what I'm gonna do.
On TV.
Nods.
I'm just an accountant.
That's right.
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Yeah, all right, listen...
Thank you.
What!?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I think this is worth a dollar.
What?
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
I've done much better ones than this.
A surprise?
Yeah.
It better be.
Do it!
What gives?
He carried on some; kicked.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
She went.
They hid in a broom closet!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
So you ain't with the State no more?
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
All to pieces!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Tricked us!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
You better not sing that song.
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
You what?
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
John, where are we g --
That's Daddy!
Ssh...
Up river.
I'll make coffee.
Huh?
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Under the stone in the floor.
Come to me, boy!
Yes?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
No.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Yes; from the first night.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
No, Harry! I thought --
Yes.
How'do.
What's wrong, John?
Them kids!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
No, nothing.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Slept like a rock.
No.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
Uh-oh...
Okay, okay.  I think.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
No.
Yeah.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Sure, but...
How you know that?
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Jungle man fix Jane.
It's from Paris.
What was it like?
Evening gown?
That's another thing... it's spring.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Monsieur.
You didn't get legal advice?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
No, sir.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Yes.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
It is Thursday!
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
What did she say about me?
No, no.
Look for yourselves.
Just looking around.
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Even the swallows are back.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
I think so too.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
You're welcome.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
That's a strange angle.
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Wounded? How?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
It's false sentimentality.
No, that was restful. Again.
The telephone is ringing.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
I don't like your following me.
At what?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
I don't think so.
No.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Anything, Ninotchka.
I don't think so.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Yes... a little white house.
Let's turn on the radio.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no music.
But I can throw it out of the window.
Yes, sweetheart. 
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
No... please...
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
I told you to go, madame.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
May I ask why?
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I don't understand.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Where the hell is he?
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
Son of a bitch.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Uh huh ...
I'll bet he would.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
There's no secrets here, Al.
That's what they're doing.
And if I stay?
How do you see this?
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
You never told him?
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What about happiness, Mother?
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Yes ...
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
I always get my man.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
I beg your pardon --
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Yeah ...
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Did you cry when he died?
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
I like jazz ...
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
Yes, yes.
Well, we could delete it.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
I don't want them to love me.
I've missed you.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
When?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
To what?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
In Angola. Yeah.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
I'm hidin' behind you.
So when was he here?
Sheriff?
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Yes Sheriff.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
I ain't got the money.
To your husband.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Just keep it up.
That'll work.
Goin' out.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
What did you tell him?
I know where it's going to be.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
You expect him?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
No me mate.
Why would I care where you're going.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
So what're you goin' up there for.
No. Do you?
I see.
Sixty-nine cent.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Sir?
I didn't put nothin' up.
Okay.
No sir, it's unusual.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Let's just call it square.
When did you last see him.
Okay. We can stop that.
I'm sorry.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
That's got two double beds.
I got beers in my room.
What else then?
I do like you.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
I didn't say braze.
What product.
I don't know.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Yeah?
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I know plenty.
Oh. How come?
I am?
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I better go check on them.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
I gotta go make dinner.
Are you and Larry happy?
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Yes, she is.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Didn't I?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
I ran back in to get the phone.
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
It's not really a good time, guys...
I begged him to let me put that on!
Did you love it?
That's horrible!
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
...did I win some contest?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
Man, that is love.
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
What? Where was he?!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
He is real.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Fine. You got five...
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
My socks?
Beer, please.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
...that's a good motto.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
...who doesn't?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
"Injuns?"
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
Sure.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Mr. Campbell?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
- and share one of your graves.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Do not seek the treasure!
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Gopher, Everett?
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
That's right, honey.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well sure, honey, but...
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
He ain't our daddy!
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
I never said any of that!
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
I called you Sarge.
No.
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Yes, sir!
What are you tired from?
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Yeah.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
What?
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Great.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Really?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
I know who you are and what you want.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Are those for me?
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
What would you do differently?
Why'd he do it?
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
That's brilliant.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Yeah. All week long.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
I can't just...
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Are you gonna open the safe?
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Shut up.
Shut up and let me think.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Yeah, whatever.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
I said open the door.
Don't!
It's okay, Raoul.
No fucking way.
Nobody leaves.
The furniture guy?
Got us in here, didn't I?
Well, I know that now.
The crowd goes wild.
Don't.
Chills?
"Titanic."
No.
I saw something, I saw...
On it!
Uh uh.
He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.
What if I keep dropping?
What if I do?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Fuck that, we've got company...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Yeah... whatever you say.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Naw... I gotta...
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
So talk...
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Yeah.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
And who is we?
Maybe...
Just the legit shit.
Nothing.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
What?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Thank you.
That would be nice.
I expect to try.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Pride will do.
He's not making light.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Thank you.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Do you?
Yes, sir.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
With a lace table cloth?
Apology accepted.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Prisoner exchange.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Is that so?
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes, sir.
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
No...
She got me at a more impressionable age.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
Please.
I stand corrected.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Balderdash!
That's five, keep going...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I'm sorry.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
But what about Thomas?
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
Worse.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Quiet.
Bite?
Is that right, dad?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
For a little while.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
I know.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
I'm sure you're not.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Allman Brothers.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
I don't know.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Is there quicksand?
You're telling me.
You keep saying that.
Your cairn.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Wendigo?
Yes.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
Aye, for us there is.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Thank you, sir.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
I can't breathe.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
-- then we never would have met.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
What?  He never told me that.
How did he get off the island?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Sorry, I didn't know.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Indeed.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Agreed!
Aye!  Avast!
My father.  William Turner?
That's not true.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
It's the right way.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
... no.
Where did he come from?
Bleak.  Very bleak.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
That remains to be seen.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
If you loved me like I loved you?
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
That might work.
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Been out for six months now.
Is that so?
I guess I should be flattered.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
The nanobot.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Daniel!
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
Three days ago it was.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
Getting used to it.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Where is it?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
We were different people then.
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Yes - Sing Sing.
Goodbye, Stew—
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
You may go, Smythe.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Gallagher!
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
I poisoned him.
Are you crazy?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Oh, hello Mother!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
You're the Tribune man?
Thanks, I will.
Is that so?
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Well - it's only April.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Yes, sir.
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
My play.
Sure.
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Dawson, sir.
Oh no, sir!
Quite so. Quite.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Nothing.
Must be my wife.
Never even been to New Madrid.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
I beg your pardon.
And now for that twentieth crack—
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
It's all right. Bring him in.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
With pleasure, Madame!
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
The name is Smythe.
No, sir!
I just putter.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
A bird in a gilded cage?
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Yeah?
Yeah ...  That--and ...
It doesn't matter.
What?
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
In my handbag.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
I won't.
Thanks ... I love you.
I'm sorry ...
Bud brought it to me.
Yes she is.
Yeah. It does.
I was in a bowling-alley.
I don't want it to go away.
Um ... It's ...
Oh, gosh no.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
You want to get out of here?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It is?
Why not?
She won't go out with me?
No it couldn't!
Oh, no thanks ...
No. What?
Rain.
Yes I do.
Well--it was dark out ...
Okay--that's enough!
You're not allowed to lie.
Oh sure it is.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
The other one?
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Owns the hardware store.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
I don't think so.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Wow.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Sure ...
No I won't. I swear.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
What department store did they go to?
McGinty's.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
I can't.
Re-runs?
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Why?
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Yes.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Yeah.
I brought you something ... From the library.
I'll never be able to do that.
TV repair?
What's the rush?
What happened?
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Cool.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Hello everyone.
Yeah I can't.
It's fine, but --
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Hi, is this Jack?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
You sound very cute, very nice.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
No.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
....what....?
We got disconnected before....
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I don't have a girlfriend --
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
They don't get opened until eight.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Hi.
It's terrible, no.
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Yeah.
It's Barry.
Nothing.
What?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
This is funny.
This is nice.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Why? ...what?
That's fine.
Hello, how are you?
Barry Egan.
-- and this is confidential?
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
That's that.
I think you have a call?
Hi Walter.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
It takes time to process --
What?
Please don't do this.
Are you going to the party tonight?
What time are you gonna be there?
Seriously.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
It's fine.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
Ok.
No.
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
"Turn you out?"
You'll hate me now, won't you?
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
You always do.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
-- that was lust --
Why was it you never took her by force?
Then it must've been love --
Of course.
It's a formality; truly.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
Of course.
And my own.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Enough!
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Don't start --
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
What's that then?
I don't believe it!
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
I pray you: be succinct.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Very much.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
I wonder sometimes.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
And he did.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
My name is Orson Welles
Do you?
Uh-hub.
There's nothing to explain
I will not defend my life to you--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
I will not have this in my home.
Sir? 
Sir?
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
Huh?
We're using-
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
He personally asked you to?
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
So speaks the court jester.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
What does this have to do with--?
It's too late. The movie's made
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Again
They've all seen a rough cut
It's just that my movie is so-
Happy birthday.
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
I know what you want but it can't be done!
We done?
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
About what?
For what?
I'm Ok.
It's not done.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
Nothing...
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Jack! Enough!
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Whadda you care?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
Yeah, she's nice.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Well, that's what I mean.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
What?
I just wanted to say hello.
It's OK.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
What're you talking about?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
What?
OK. Talk.
I'm leaving you Jake.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
What friends?
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Right, the gym.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Oh. When are they expected home?
When the lock is broken -- yes.
That's what they call a family problem.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You think I made all this up?
For instance?
Thanks.
Do that.
Not yet.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Mrs. Thorwald.
You think he's getting out of here?
You figured that out, huh?
Your Lisa?
Like what?
A possibility.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Why should I?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Well, I only quote from the best.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
She expects me to marry her.
Stella!
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
I was.
Depends one which one.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
Would four of them -- ?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Mrs. Doyle?
You haven't even heard from him?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Empty as a football.
Tired?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Of course not.
Without any future?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What's the apartment house number?
To get on home.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Who was the trunk addressed to?
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
How?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
I'm glad they let you out.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
I'm cute, too.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
You still want to go home, Moose?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Shoot, Jimbo.
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
I was in it.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
Sorry.
Have some cigars.
I think I know my son.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
I still think you should go down.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Head-shrinker?
No.  I don't think so--
What?
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
Who knows.  Plato?
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Who's that!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Judy.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Not lately.
Who?
I've got a gun.
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
My gun?
Just a guard.
All right, darling.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Good Lord!
What's that got to do with it?
Just tell a little white lie?
Grandma?
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
Leave me alone.
Chicken?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
"Life is crushing in on me."
You going there?
Dig the square wardrobe!
Oh.
I'm numb.
Neither can I.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I felt like it.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
See, we're very modern.
You don't need to do that.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
It is for me too.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Okay.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
What?
I didn't want to stop.
Don't hurt him...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
He'll be dead when he does.
No, no --
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
What.
One more. Smile. One more.
Yes it was all you --
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Your brother...
What's going ON!!!
Nick --
You told him about Nick's letters.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Canada.
Jack. Jack Bangs.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Nick...
Nick, the ice is --
You saved me.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
What?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
She says a lot of things.
What college.
Might as well be.
Don't tip.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
NO!
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Six men means six guns.
How'd you know my name...
Leave the tree.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
GO!!!
What?
Five years. Since it opened.
My what?!
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Where the hell's Gabriel?
Merlin, I didn't know --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Thought you hate your old man.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Good for you. Protein.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
And you set me up.
I... sorry, Mister...
Well...sorry...
I'm ninety-two years old --
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Who?
Where was she from, Compton?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
What for?
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Who gives a damn?
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Mr. Pink.
He don't believe in it.
Freddy Newendyke.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Down to my car.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
No, I'm not!
It's not good...
I can' take you to a hospital.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
Where?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
For all I know, you're the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Well, he knows a little about me.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
He asked.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Yeah, those guys too.
Maybe he did.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Nobody. The light was bad.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
As far as -- Sonora?
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
He's learning his letters.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Thanks.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
That's fine.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
To the other side of the street.
Hello, Miss Wells.
A man I used to know.
All right. I'll tell you.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Good thing you didn't.
That's right, Steve.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Kind of sore.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
That's it then.
I don't care what he thinks.
Everybody knows --
What for?
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
I sure would.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
No. We're not stayin' --
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Would they be good to eat?
Steve --
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Hello Ray.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Yeah.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Then what are we going to do?
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I think so.
What, you think I did this to myself?
It's the sequel.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Yes!!!!
Quick, everyone to the lab.
I'll go.
Alright, let's take a vote...
My child, you're alive!
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Saw who?!
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
In about fifteen minutes.
Right. What about condoms?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Thanks, handyman.
Alright, go to the belt store...
How is she?
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Dog, you look hot.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Is MOM... in there?
No more violence... No more violence...
He's really cute!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
But Mom, the video's not over.
You scared me.
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Don't I get a kiss?
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Oohhhh, Eugene!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Oh, honey!
What a mess.
I certainly did.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
COCKSUCKER! 
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
Sure I do.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Where?
Can we go there now?
Which room is it?
Yes.
No.
As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
But I like teaching school.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
What does she do with herself after business hours?
Yes.
But you do believe me?
But you have treated me that way.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Good night.
We could tell him.
Not from me.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Yes.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
What a peculiar question.
But why come to me?
She was my patient.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
I should like people to read what I've written.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
I think it's time.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
Perhaps
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
One believes -— it's like any other religion...
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
No. She's no longer under my care.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
I'm very, very serious.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Do you want me to?
You're in therapy?
You had sex with you therapist?
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Maybe you want to go.
I know.
Do you want me to stop?
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
Yes.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
Don't you get lonely?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
No.
I don't know.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
I'm okay. It's okay.
You did that?
Mmmmm...
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Who'd you have lunch with?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I want out of this marriage.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Yes.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Radon leakage?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Did you find him attractive?
Yes.
Why?
I have a pretty good idea.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
What kinds of questions?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Cynthia!
You are in trouble.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Thirty-two dollars.
Well. I can't stay.
Okay.
Bye.
Did you take your clothes off?
So will you, someday.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Just a moment.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
No? Not even one more?
So make an exception.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
Right.
You told Ann about this?
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
It'll just be me.
No.  You said three-fifty?
You were prying before?
Really. How'd it go?
I like having the car, the car is important.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
Brian Kirkland, please.
John Millaney.
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Yeah.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Hi. Want a drink?
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Sure.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
We live in 703.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Huh?
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
What?
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Who trusts experts?
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
...closed?
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
I don't want to get up there.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Who?
Why?
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Farley!
Foods!
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
It'll just take a second.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
And?
Yeah, I'm here.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Stephanie.
Good. How're you?
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
That's on us.
Maybe. Recognize this?
I can't help the traffic.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh yeah. Much better.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
I owe her a call anyway.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
What color is it supposed to be?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Just a minute!
If that's what feels right.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Shut up.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
I want to go home now.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
Aye-aye, captain.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Count me out.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
That was three years ago after that first party!
Thanks, Jack.
Nope.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
What exactly are we going to do?
You have to tell me --
No.
What's up?
Thanks.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
What?
No way. No way.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Quite a week.
You said it looked like a car accident.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Sure.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Hey.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Like what a fraud he was.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Well, nice to see you now.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I'm pregnant.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
She doesn't answer me either.
No dad!
You don't even know what that word means.
I don't feel much.
I'm here.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
Curse and stuff.
Just make noises then.
Are you going to do this or what?
I heard.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
That's right.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
I'm close.
Don't.
Yes.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
Where are we going to sleep?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
Pinned? What does that mean?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Your next water ain't for three days.
Sure.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
They've been kind to me.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
It's one thing to know it...
My name is Emmett.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Ten A.M.
Not for five years.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
He is that.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
No hard feelings.
You haven't got any money.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
What's that?
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
All I did was kiss the girl.
Let's get out of here.
I'm done talking. Get out.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
You're kidding.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Good luck, Mal.
You don't know?
Luck, I guess.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
Why'd you go into business with him?
Give me some of the good stuff.
Of course.
I am telling the truth.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Excuse us.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
Please.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Almost right.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
-- I can explain.
No.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Not if I don't let her.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Of course.
Yes, call me Simone.
And what may I ask brought this on?
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
I know what you mean.
-- Please, get away from me.
I was misquoted.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
You saw that?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
This week anyhow.
Really?  Too bad.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Lainey...
What?!
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
This is the story.
Abduction?
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Why?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Yes.
But that's Simone's part.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Tell me.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
No, just one.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
That's good.
How do you draw now?
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Look over there.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Yes.
What?
I don't know.
Yes, it did.
No, we're not.
No.
You do?
Maybe.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Yeah.
Yes.
Standing next to my window.
They scare me too sometimes.
They want me to do things for them.
What?
Stop looking at me.
Chuck E. who?
J. C. Penny's?
Superstition.
Chicken blood on the crops.
What's a "little while?"
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Sorry.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
I could. You sucked.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Harvest moonshining!
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
I'll be fine here.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
Not while you're driving.
What's wrong?
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Who you callin' "boy?"
He's right. You were behind.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
Let it go.
Look. You want to talk about this?
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Bill, we need to talk!
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Starla, it ain't --
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Good.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Sorry.
I got to leave my post.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
What can I do you for?
Out.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
Grant, no!
What other stuff?
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Margaret.
If...?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Okay.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Yeah.
You could've asked.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
Weight Station.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
You sure do.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
How'd you know?
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Go.
Yeah?
Redneck heaven.
This is Bandit I, come back.
I ran into complications.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
That's correct.
You have a butler working that floor?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Yeah.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Yeah, why.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
I got his machine.
I left him a message.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- will be handled back in --
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
...So you made another deal?
-- he's doing it then, huh --
A million flat.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
You love her?
Like a mafucka.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
What's the time frame?
What do you want?
Can it work?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Not her.  It.
What?
He'll let me in.
Who was it?
My wife.
I don't know.
Why?
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Just get him to stop.
I love her.
Yes.
You didn't look very happy.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
You don't love me.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Rheya.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Gibarian.  He was here.
He is.  But he was here...
I'm disgusting.
I can't stay here.
Who are you, then?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
You must have been dreaming.
It's an experiment.
I'm not Snow.
Fuck me.  I knew it.
Hello, Win.
You didn't like him?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
I'll come with you.
No kidding.
Could be, I guess.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
You don't like him, do you?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Sleep good.
Let go!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
I don't know.
Oh God, that's great!
Oh that thing in Queens.
Mike...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Just putting in an appearance then.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
I don't know Tommy.
Absolutely.
Too kinky.
Get in bed.
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Why?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
I watched TV.
What's the difference?
No.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
I heard.
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
No, sir...
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
What the fuck you doin'?!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Shooting?
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
A spider.  Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
Thanks, I already ate.
I hate people with alliterative names.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
I'm here...
So you've found Thorkel?
Any sign of our friend?
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Aunt May, what happened?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Imagine how I feel.
Just drop me off here.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Looks good outside.
Roger.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Take it.
Forget it.
How much more do we have to take from him?
You are talking crazy!
What are the chances busting out of here?
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
What exactly is he charged with?
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Some are not bad at all.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Stop it, Harry!
Me? What if she don't want me?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
She'll never forgive me!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Do Jimmy Durante!
It's that song, Harry!
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
You starting that again?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You told them, Hoffy.
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Shoot!
You can tell Father Murray to --
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
What about the radio?
Are you questioning me?
What did you say?
What time?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Not particularly.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I hope so, sir.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
You're in the Nexus.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
Better?
I hadn't planned on it.
You could say that.
Phasing? To where?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
A photon torpedo?
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
What do you want?
No, I didn't know that.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Thank you.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Aye, sir.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Put me on the hailing frequency.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
On screen.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
I have already made one transmission too many...
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Aye, sir!
Aye, sir!
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Just him, sir!
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
... A cloaking device?
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Welcome home, Jim.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Any time.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Yes...
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Understood, my lord.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
How is that...?
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Ah.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Is that a poem?
Maybe...
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
But we can't just sit here -- !
Ssssh!
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
We appear to have plenty of time.
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
Only half of you would get there.
I shall avenge you --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
KHAN!
Scotty, let's have it.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Give the word, Admiral.
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Not at present.
How far?
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Aye sir --
Uhura, patch me in --
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
Because... there was no way to win.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You earned it.
HURRY.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
Erased...
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
They just don't want us going in there.
At what.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
What do you mean?
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Come on, Pavel...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Like what?
Name?
Shields, aye.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
I suppose they told you that...?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Implicitly.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What do you mean now?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
All right. The truth?
You want the details?
Noon tomorrow...?!
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
In progress, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
Surely you can be more specific...
What are the variables...?
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
Exaggerate.
The tank will be finished by morning...
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Right.  Will you help us?
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Yes, sir.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Millions?
That's the ticket, laddie.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
There are caves in those mountains.
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
What's the rush?
I thought it might begin the healing process.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
For what purpose?
No.
Are they in any danger?
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
From the mission...
Another time.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
Understood.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
The Ba'ku.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
May I talk to you alone?
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
... had regenerated.
On screen.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Make it so.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
We have to find shelter...
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
Why was Data assigned?
But it's comfortable.
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
I believe so.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Ready quantum torpedo.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
What?
But how?
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
I told you, there's no --
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Let's go.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Great name. French?
You don't sound French.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
No. It's a lot further than that.
No... I'm from France.
That's impossible.
On screen.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Aye, sir.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Onscreen.
Life signs?
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Where the hell are they going?
What are you suggesting?
What kind of message?
That's the question -
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
I didn't mean this future.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
No way.  You see this?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
Come on...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
That's a comfort...
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
Very much.
You feign ignorance?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Well, I -
Your honors, the State rests.
Uhura, monitor!
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Who else?
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
He's got it.
Candidate for what?
Captain, if --
Aye, sir.
WHO ELSE...?
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Captain.
Sir?
Uhura, signal our surrender.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
When does this conference start?
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I am uncertain.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
What peace conference?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
... is to trust him.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Who else?
Such things have happened before, sir.
Not as yet, sir.
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
I don't want to.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
Nevertheless.
I know precisely where he'll be.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Aye, aye, sir.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
I am in a room with lights.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I know.
For how long?
He turned out all right.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Now, you make a toast.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
It'll only work for one of us.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
Divert power and compensate.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
An individual more like you, you mean.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Do you have a moment, sir?
And I you.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Do you have life support?
Understood.
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
What programs were accessed?
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Aye, sir.

There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
What sort of signature?
On screen.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Counselor?
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Praetor Shinzon?
Yes.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
I have no reason to.
Yes.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
I won't defend my life to you.
Why are you here?
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
On my way.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Do as I tell you!
They're holding position.
They will obey, Praetor.
I have a purpose.
Silence, Romulan!
Praetor.

And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
I don't see anything.
Sure.
It's still the full price.
About five miles back.
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Marc Shermin.
What.
Eh... police.
Money.
No gas.
Space?
Horses.
Three nights... two days.
I need you.
When we get here.
Why?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Can I have the gun?
Go?
I was afraid.
It was a mistake.
Yes?
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I don't understand 'friend.'
What is hell?
He will.
Why?
No. Get in.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I feel better if I move.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Nothing.
Yes, they are.
But...
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
Where?
I must go.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
My grandmother's rich.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
We better get it into the box. Come on...
Yes.
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I don't understand.
Judy, that's stupid.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
Just not the eyes.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Forget it's there.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
Damn right.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Step into my office.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
Yeah.  No, not really.
Why me?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Naawww.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Who was just here?
What clip?  What was it?
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Fumitsu.
Coming with you.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Wants to share.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Jesus, Mace!
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Fire's out, isn't it?
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
You sure?
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Why?
I'm not going.
No, it's not.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
That's right, Jan.
This isn't in our database?
What's the bad news?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What do you want from me?
What kind?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
What I do requires confidentiality.
I don't believe this.
Collected shoes too?
I didn't use Low's name.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
That information's being withheld from the media.
This is some serious shit.
And one other thing.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
We did find these, however.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Sue Ann Hanson.
What's that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Jaime? Where are you?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Does one exist?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
Yes.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
It was the mall.
Those were just fantasies.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Sounds like fun.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
The same.
I talked to him.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
It's over for you.
You're right. I know.
It didn't feel that way.
Shuddup.
...maybe...
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Just like that?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
What else is going on?
...then ask where you met her...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Could you believe it?
I'm a comedian.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Are you on the other line?
I can call back...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Fine... I guess. You?
Really?
Why didn't you call?
...the Michelin commercial...
I heard you might be moving back...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
You don't call.
Right.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
Classy.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Well, let's hit that party.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
No. Just O.J.
You always know the right thing to say.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
So, what? Eleven?
Not well.
You asshole.
...People get carjacked...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
I don't know...
What?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Whu?
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
What?!?
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yea, how much?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Let's just leave.
Let's go.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
No! Not the camera guy!
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She thought you were money.
What?!?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Aww... He got away?
Minnie Pearl.
What?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
We're not messing with you...
No, baby!
A day.
Oh. He's got it under control...
They're a finesse team...
...It's on.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Our little baby's growing up...
Six.
An eye for an eye!
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Yeah.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Understood.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
For killing a man.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
You look good, too.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Mike!
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
Okay.  One minute.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Can you do it Mike?
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Mama, no.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Did he give you his politicians?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
No.
How is your father?
I love you.
Please say it.
When will I see you again?
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
Until the old man tells me different.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Cut it out.
Be patient.
Thanks.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Sure. Any time.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Did you speak to my father?
No, I like him.
I don't like you.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Can you mix a martini?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Marge! You've got to hear this!
What?
I love jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Your parents met her.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
I thought you'd missed the train.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
That's good.
Ripley's plans.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I love Marge.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Sure.
What are you doing?
Aye, aye.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Have you done something to your hair?
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
What's going on?
He's not a man, he's a god.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Marge, when did you get here?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Hello Marge!
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Excuse me?
What?
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Hello Meredith.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You know what -- I am.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Thanks.
I can't later.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
It's okay.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
I'll fix some drinks.
You try. You try talking to her.
I give up.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
Even your fiancée...?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Nah. I ain't interested.
Who mam?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
I can believe that.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I bought a couple of tickets.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
I mean porno movies.
Hello, Betsy.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Thank you, Travis.
Yeah.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Ouch!
You sure he's not Italian?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
You carry a piece? You need one?
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
That's not hard to do.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
My work may take me out of New York.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
How's your driving record?
Shit.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Slow.
I know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Neither do I, I guess.
You know how I feel about what you do.
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
It's all I could think of.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Partners.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
I wish you were coming with me.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Okay.  What's the second thing?
How'd they get it inside?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Yes.  Hic!
Have you got a cigarette?
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
By all means.
Shhhhhh.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
A super market.  Huh.
Harry, son.  Harry.
Ah.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
... what?
The film broke...
Vultures...
No, sir.
I guess I did.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Call me... Ishmael?
Wish I could say the same thing.
We live in a theater?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
I... I don't believe this.
Who the hell is this "they?"
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Luke didn't smoke.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
No.
Yes.  Very.
Yes?
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
I despise it.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Because she was afraid.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Cathy!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Oh, I suppose so.
I know.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
Yep.
That's where the Brenners live.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Mmmm.
D'you want me to order one for you?
The little Brenner girl?
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
What happened?
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I know, Mother.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I don't know.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
But they'll be back.
What?
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
And if you don't?
We know what it is, Al.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
That's all right.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
How can you tell?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
We met in court.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
You are, aren't you?
Famished.
Oh, yes.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I told you what happened in Rome!
It is for me.
Cheers.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Yes.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Hear!
Mmm?
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Inland.
Maybe.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Yes.
I have no idea.
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Of course.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
Good morning.
Ask this one favor --
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
Aye.
MacFarlane
Where can I find him?
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
Well? And are you not a good student?
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
What?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
He was a nice horse.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
You will not have it?
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
The heart pumps it.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
I take no gifts from you.
Get out of here!
Yes.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
Aye --
Aye.
Where are they?
Where are they? Last chance.
I'm looking for my friends.
Tell her... we'll get him.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
I don't know you, man.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
How can you die if you're already dead?
I was talking about you.
Someone else did it.
I told you, I knew your sister.
Yeah, I know.
My father.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Yeah, we do.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
You killed my daughter.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
No.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I assure you such power exists.
Yes.
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Okay.
What do you mean, dear?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Yes, I have!
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Where is that?
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
About 250 million of your miles.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
Is it real?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
What about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Jittery is the word.
Naturally I think so.
Goodnight, my dear.
May I walk out with you?
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Would you like to sell it?
I'd give you a very good price.
How long will that take?
We don't ride with vampires.
You gotta drive!
Time to activate Plan B.
<u>Four</u> to go.
What?...
Why?  They're only noodles.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
Hey, take it easy.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
How do you know they're not?
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
He's already gone to bed.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Hi, Thorn.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Star.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
I was here first.
Nowhere.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
No.  On the phone.
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
I don't know.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Anybody sick?
Finish what?
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
I don't know who to trust.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Cool it, Palmer!!
Ain't it there?
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
The dogs?
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
That's good enough.
What clothes?
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Come on, Copper.
All in Norwegian.
I guess I'm the only one.
Damn you, MacReady!
When was the last time you used it?
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
I am going after them.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Move it, Palmer.
I ain't going with Sanchez.
He's dead.
Can you think of any other tests?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
Then we go after him.
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
I had an accident.
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
But you're only a mud carrier.
This is it?
Excuse me?
I'm used to that.
It frightens you.
It was meant to.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
What do you mean?
End...?
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
I know.
I just love mechanical things.
What's happening to the moon?!
Got here as soon as I could.
What?
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
How romantic...
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Perseverance.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
For God's Sake, David --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
Sir...?
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
You can see so many here.
Yes.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Or mud carriers.
You liked it there.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
You lost someone.
Is it?
It's undamaged?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Imagine that.
Do they?
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
We don't know.
We choose to believe it.
Dean Fulton...
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
That's quite enough, Kalen.
For our sake, I hope not.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
In where?
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
My business?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
And what does that mean?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
No, we were patients.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
That's too bad.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Jackie.
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
What?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They're not.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
[Beat] I don't know.
No, he didn't.
Good. How's your mom?
Ok.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I'm doing fine.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
So it's helping?
I never knew my father. Did you?
Why?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Maybe.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
I did?
You have nothing to fear, William.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Is it true?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
So you never knew your mother?
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
What.
Uh-huh.
What?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
In the leg.
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
How are things goin' out there?
You want to come on in?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
My Lord.
Oh, definitely.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
What's wrong?
What for?
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Well, you wanna use the shower?
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Who's your friend?
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Maybe.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
West.  Left.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
She thinks he's a pig.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Try to.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
What.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
You mean now or before?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
About how fast was I going?
Hit it.
I believe you.
Yes.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Are you alright?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
It'd have to be pretty good.
You're drivin'.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Yup.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
It's grand!
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
What?
The thing's kind of heavy.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Yeah, but he was successful.
Good-looking?
Loser? You?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Huh? But why did Healy?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Mints?
Who?
Oh come on, why would I lie?
You got a brew?
Healy, what I just tell you?
Nepal? Have you been?
You own a home there?
It's right there on your golf bag.
What's that?
No, I mean
-- He's in a cage?!
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
You're a movie buff?
Have you seen it?
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Huh... that's strange.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Forget it. It was... fun.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Who the hell's Woogie?
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
Really?  Very, very?
So she's married?
What?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Nice.
I never said that.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Puffy, get over here.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Huh?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Hm?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Mary, come on...
You're Woogie?
Really?
You got what stuck?
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
Shhhhhh!
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Huh...?
Tomorrow...
Where the hell are you?
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What if I can't?
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Cuba.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
What about you? Where are you going?
No you weren't.
Not as far as the election goes.
I know, I know...
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
You're sure...
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
You're my hero, Carl.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
Sioux Indian, right?
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Ray.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
How'd you know?
Go ahead.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
When did we get that?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
No way, Cooch.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
He also said "listen to the water."
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Likewise.
Cuz you're a cop.
Crow Horse, listen --
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
So they took care of Leo.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
You didn't have another vision...
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Good.
Ray. What's your 20?
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
Mister Tully.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
I could be, too.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
Yeow!
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
No.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Too aggressive?
Evan... or Maverick.
The what?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
How about anything, anything you want to do.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
Make what?

Winston Churchill.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
You always get what you want?
Anything.
I'm still second best.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
I'm fine.
Not to me.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
How could you?
Well what?
What?  What is it?
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Roger, I've got it.
Just relax.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Any more MiGs?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
On what?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
No shit. The Iceman....
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
SHIT!!
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Three guesses.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Yes sir!
The wings..
Yes sir.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
I'm nothing like him.
He was by the book, all the way.
I never heard that.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
But maybe you can change all that.
Who are you?
How'd you find me?
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
It's about goddamn time.
What is it?
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Hetero.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Arrest that woman!
We don't have much choice then, do we?
You tell me.
Melina!
Oh, Rekall.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Up!
How did I get in this taxi?!
Quit while you're ahead.
But I'm always home by morning.
All right, forget about it.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
I love you.
What are you talking about?
Hauser left me a note.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
I saw them.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
Oh, since when?
You two-faced-bastard.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
In a minute.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
No.  We go straight.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Has a lot of rain.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
That's the plan.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Adios, bridge!
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
The rifle.
Oh shit!
Sons of bitches!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
I think we wait right here.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
We got a plan!
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
You bet.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Around here?  Why would they?
Yeah.  One, two, three...
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
An hour after you picked it up!
He was your snitch.
What about entrapment?
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
We had a description of the suspect.
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Not at all --
Right. You're right.
I specialize, Roger...
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
-- Yeah?
That's why I hate experts.
I'm not that desperate.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
It was self-defense.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
No, s-sir.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
Calls for speculation.
-- alleged crime --
-- Every word.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
Shu's the only one I know of...
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Here he comes.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Did she have someone with her?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
And neither will I.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Where's Hap?
Did she ever mention any friends?
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
How do you figure?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Maybe.
Well, why not?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Nothing.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
I haven't got it yet.
Who would do that?
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
I'm not.
I already made you two tapes.
Hey, Jacques...
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
James...
Not now.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
What?
Fish eyes?
What?
What were you doing in my room?
Mom... what are you wearing?
Mom, take it easy.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
Fine.
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
No.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Yes.
You thought it was just.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.
No.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
I'm on the staff of...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.
When she...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
I completely understand...
Hold on a second.
...I made a reservation at...
...What difference would...
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes? Galvin, right?
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
You're going to settle out of court?
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
Hi. How are you doing?
How old is he?
Yes.
Yes...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
I think I will.
Maybe what?
I've got to work.
Isn't there something you...
Is there going to be a later...?
No... no...
No.
I have to talk to you.
No.
I've got nothing to say to you.
Yes. Yes, I have.
...I understand...
He's not in, Sir.
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Oh shit, what's today?
I'm swell.
Yeah.
You use their witness.
...one of the other nurses?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
I don't know.
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
As I've said we had some more...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
How'm I doing so far?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
Me, too.
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
All right - I've seen enough!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
What's he like?
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
It was...  ...one of them!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
What?
No biggie, really.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Chase. Hi...
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Your bed?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
Yes?
Listen, dammit.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
They wouldn't let me...
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Black's fine.
Not yet.
Yep.
Your father?
You miss him.
He knows.
Guilty.
I can take it.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Yeah, sure.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
Whatever.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
To take a piss.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
Figured what out?
That's not why he's sending me.
It was a bad dream...
Like this!
What's the difference?
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Yes.
Maybe it's an air raid.
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
How do you know?  They might.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
I can't make it out?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Twice.
No.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Why'd you jump?
I couldn't do it.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
What?
He climbed when he was ready.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
I am accountable.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
No, haven't heard of it.
You an indian?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
Whattaya do there?
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
How's that?
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
See ya downstairs.
Peanut...
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
And you never told nobody about it?
Here she goes again...
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yeah?
She got me an abortion...
What's that?
You up for that?
You mean like pedal pushers?
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
What kinda trash talk is that?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Uh huh.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Under a hundred.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
If you say so.
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
Let's get outta here, honey.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
And Bobby too, I hear...
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
What makes sense, is all.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I told you not to?
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Santos...
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
No... But...
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
I thought you were tinkering.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Back up. Go out the other way.
Tripp, where the hell...
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Only in your bones?
So sensitive.
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Don't touch it.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Call it a hunch.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
It's mine.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
And your wife left you.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
'Fraid so.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Yea?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
It's colder in there.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Who?
Blocked.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
So where have you been staying?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
No.
Maybe...
Glaucoma?
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
I never heard of it.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
How can you tell?
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
No thanks.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Do?
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
All right. This morning --
Hm.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
I heard.
Really, Sara, I...
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Over there. In the backseat of the...
I know, but sometimes...
Why yes. How did you know?
I'm not sure that's possible.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
I... I...
I don't know. It might be...
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
Why did you come here, Grady?
I might have his number on campus.
What?
How old is Anna?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
You need a table.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
No thanks.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
I'm not a monster.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
Is that right?
The mother sure has her hands full.
It's a bright sound.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
I have friends.
Okay.
What?
Fairy tales?
Know what?
I could take you downtown.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
It's a free country, isn't it?
What?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
No you're not.
Yes?
Can't I stay a little longer?
That was a joke.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Bad idea.
You think reflection is good.
How's that?
No fucking way.
I don't feel anything.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Have to talk about something.
We have a few more minutes.
I'm afraid not.
Is this the first one?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
In my bed too.
We're little kids.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Nothing.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
I feel... okay.
Are you okay?
What picture?
You must hate it.
Maybe later.
The morning?
Yeah.
What did you do to them?
No. Never again.
Who doesn't?
What's your fucking problem?
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
How deep's the drop-off here?
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Your rig?
Not for long.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
They'll come out after us.
I don't know, look around.
Calm down, Bud.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
What's the plan?
Who then?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Yuh?
I can't... make it... podner.
Missed what?
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Turn it up, bozo.
Give me that!!
How many are there?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
She'll wait.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
Wait for what?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
This one is gorgeous.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Who knows why they all left...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Why?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
What do you mean by sensible?
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
There too...
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
What boat?
I don't see why I should mind.
You know, I don't love anybody.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Is that possible?
Through someone else?
Who?
Who tells you these things?
It made them holy.
No.
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Love.
Yes.
Everyone.
Oh, I know he does.
Oh, yes.
Did it hurt?
And then what?
In the middle of all the pain?
Where did the baby come from?
Agnes...
No.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
You'll laugh.
No.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
I'm always bad.
I breathed!
I can't.
Yes.
She watches... she listens.
... makes me...
Yes.
Alright.
Yes.
Doctor Livingston.
To help me.
It grew.
No.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Yes.
How did she know about him?
Yes.
Agnes, who did this to you?
I put her to sleep.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Why?
Marty, what are you doing here?
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
If I find anything I'll call you.
What about Roger? He's free.
Who told you this?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
So, someone else could have done it.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Answers.
Yes.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I don't think I care to know.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Nothing...
Long, thin and filtered.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For the Church?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
Then she's a liar.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Yeah?
I'm a deserter, too.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Spoil sport!
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No. I don't.
Yeah, grotesque.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Have I said something amiss?
No, straight up.
He's sulking again.
We do.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I'm not ...
Yes.
The big hammer?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Nothing good.
I'll look after meself.
Every morning.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
So's mine.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Ah, go on, you swine.
Well you're not going.
You wouldn't!
No, I'm not.
What have you heard?
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
He'll get over it.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Y'what?
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Is that you, Roby?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
Receiving.
Take a look.
No, I want to go in.
Take care.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Has the hull been breached?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
The water will still recycle.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Right.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Ask him.
What do you mean?
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Don't be an idiot.
Sounds like a rough one.
Oh my God.
It's time for drastic remedies.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
We're not going anywhere.
I think it's fizzled out.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Let's let the machine work on him.
Yes, thank heaven.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Yeah?
Well, it's finally happened.
Engine room, what happened?
Good!  Moisture content?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Even simple.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Go ahead, Jay.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Let's be democratic.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
I'll get you out of there.
Sure.
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Thanks.
Yep...
What's happening?
And?
Get her on-line.  Now!
Has anybody talked to them?
Do it.
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
How?
Couple more seconds!
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
How tight are these shafts?
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
What?  Why?
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Agreed.
No!
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
You should hit the sack, too.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Phoebe.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Please do.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Yes. I do.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
D-day.
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
... and Karen.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
What of it?
Yes, Addison.
You can have one at Max's.
Why not?
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Then you've heard too.
You were there? At the play - last night?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Huh?
Everything... everything's so funny...
Show me a human and I might have!
I'm a junk yard.
Huh?
That I am...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
See you...
I thought you were going to be late-
That never stopped you before.
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
What's all over?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I've been aware of that for some time.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Glory Hallelujah.
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Groom.
A married lady.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Why you have to go out there.
Is it the money?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
It's only one picture deal.
Also Addison deWitt.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
So am I.
No thanks, Birdie.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
Oh-oh.
Now you want an argument.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
I - I guess I fell asleep.
What for?
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
My husband...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
There can't be very much-
Let's not get over-dramatic.
- an understudy's performance.
Something most important you can do.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Thank you, Karen.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
You've what?
I'm so happy you're happy.
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
I just can't believe it.
In a minute...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
That was a pity...
I wonder why.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Not much.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
The play? All right, I guess...
How do you mean?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
That's beside the point.
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
I promise.
Answer my question!
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Yeah?
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
About the past year.
The fucking New York Times.
--see?--
--fifteen phone calls--
Why didn't we get that?
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
You're not a kid anymore.
--shit--
If he self-destructed.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
Hmm?
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
11:30.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
Well of course.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
--yes--
And?--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
I will not talk about the other two.
I'm not your source on that.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--you double-checked both sources?--
Go on.
I don't know titles.
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
Electronic surveillance.
--I'm not here.
So?
You're a lawyer and you're here--
...you're definitely doing a story...?
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
To where?
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Haldeman too?
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Howard Hunt here.
James McCord.
It may never come out.
Nobody ever had too much.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Lotsa hints--
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--can we use their names?--
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
The what to what?
You need some work, buddy!
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Neither did I!
Uh-huh.
Seduce her.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
You can call me Oz.
How did you know I was here?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
I'm not playing.
Then don't.
What?
Of course.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Pontificated.
Went home to shit.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
You fuckin' rule!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
These are for you.  From father to son.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
I told you.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Don't you want me to?
Okay!
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
So do I, Kev.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
You've got something going?
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well...uh...
Strip?
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
God dammit, Stifler!
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Not for you.
I think "shithead" really says it.
How?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Yeah, right here.
I love you.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What?!  How do I do that?
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
I think we're falling in love.
Fuck yeah we will.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
But you better hurry.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
What?
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Serafine...?
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
I know. He told me.
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Yeah. French fries...
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Really.
What?
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Well, they are French.
Andy...
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Oh no... no....
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
I told him it wasn't ready...
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
I told you. These murders are not normal.
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I'm not sure but look. . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Who's Sophie?
Come out! I can do alterations.
Yes, your highness.
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I have my reasons.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Why?
It's the best fork of all
Sad?
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
Is it? Is this what you want?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Shut up!
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Watch me.
Run, Anya -  go...
Remove him at once.
And tell me that she's happy.
You don't want my autograph.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Yes.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Yeah? Allison what?
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
Well, stop listening to him.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Hey, that was last year.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Okay.
Yeah.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
think that's, uh-
Yeah!
Okay. Yeah.
Good? I was-
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Yeah.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Yeah.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
U-huh.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Following is different. I was spying.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
M'hm.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Sinatra?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Nothing at all?
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
Why are you so hostile?
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
My head is throbbing.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Yeah.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
What are you depressed about?
I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
It's a narrow view.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Hey.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
You'll total the whole car.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
I don't know, I mean, I-
Yeah. Right.
His wife has diabetes!
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Oh, yes, yes.
You think so? Do you really?
Oh.
I don't know. I don't know.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Very well.
It's the way they do things.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
Why didn't you come in?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
One guess.
Why last?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
What?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
Not this time.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
Of course.
Borrow whatever you like.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
And you're not the wife.
Fuck you.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
You really need to be fucked.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Harry called.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Did you invite them?
Beats a lawsuit.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
I'll say as little as possible.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Truce?
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
It's a novel.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Don't push me away.
I'll be with you.
Me too.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Ah there's our snookums now.
I meant Sally.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Lemon.
That's a lot of those.
I like you.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Trust him.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Not good.
Sally?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Oh?
Really??
If he were still alive, maybe.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Oh great.
It could be worse.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
What are they?
Evie has a little something for you.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Yes.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Divinely?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Well I guess that makes us even.
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Superior numbers, kid!
Barbatus?
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
No, sir!
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
...Ants...
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Yeah.  How much?
Well, I have some paper towels --
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
Yeah.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
What time does the show go on?
So I see.
Oh.
You shouldn't.
Cheers.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
This is a bad day for me.
Why?
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
I don't understand --
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
No -- I don't want anything.
I mean -- her apartment.
No -- it's my stomach.
They had to pump it out.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
A bad insurance risk?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
I just want some fresh air.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Where?
Might as well go all the way.
You usually eat alone?
What?
I don't?
Oh.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
What for?
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's right, Baxter.
What kind of joint are you running?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Are you going to deny it?
You better.
Yes, sir.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Oh?  Oh!
Relax, Baxter.
You too, sir.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
So what's it going to be?
No I didn't.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Yeah.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Sure.
It's regulations.
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Good night.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
I took sleeping pills.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
You know I liked it better long.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Important?
Handle what?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
He wouldn't.
I told you -- with my mother.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
It won't happen again.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
See if they'll what?
Yeah.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Let's talk about you.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
We do.
A long time.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Let's go.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
I'll go with him --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
Anyone got a cigarette.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
Okay, Willard, sit down.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
What about an American named Kurtz?
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Sure -- fine --
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Wh -- what?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
I got bored in Saigon.
Haiphong.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Music?
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
You knew him best.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
That's me.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
You're Australian?
Why didn't he shoot you?
I should be checking on the boat.
No. Not really.
Right now -- I am.
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
107  CONTINUED:
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
139  CONTINUED:
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
Your infrared camera?
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
The radio's on the fritz.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
That's my line.
I'm staying.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
You know Meyerling?
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
How many do you see?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
It's a long shot.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Emergency room only.
I've got Jews at my table.
No.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
What are you doing here?
How do you know about my mother?
How ya doing?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
What's that got to do with it?
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Fries.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.
To hell with sex.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Go ahead.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Okay.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
What are you trying to do to me?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
So am I, Frank.
He's a pain in the ass.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Okay by me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
What?
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
How're you doing?
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Thanks.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
You consider your life easy.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
What restaurant?
I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
What?
You would be.
What?
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
The contract was stolen.
I know.  It was a joke.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Robert?  Robert?
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Turn off the engine.
Until a minute ago.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
We don't have a choice.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
It's not the same, is it?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Jesus -- why?
Why not?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Why not?
Because I want to know.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Thinking.
No.
Yes.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Okay.  Then what?
What?  What if he brings it with him?
That means you won't have a gun.
Except --
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
So?
Jesus, if someone had --
Thank you.
Why?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Why?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
It can be.
She was taken.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Honestly?
Martin.
Right.
Okay.
Yes.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Yes.
Anything.
You mean quit?
American currency.
Thank you.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
What did the beer cost?
An alternative literary venue!
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Tough break.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
What?
So I hear.
Lucky break!
Did you see anything in the files?
Good, what's his number?
I'm not hungry, really.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
What?
Sure I'm sure!
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
You used to read.
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
There's nothing there for me.
Great....How long will it go for?
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
How?
Deal!
Well she sure isn't normal.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
I had it coming from someone.
Sometimes.
Sure!
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Fuck you!
No!
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Working....Under cover.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Later.
Why?
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
With you.
I'll tell her you were here.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
No. I won't be long.
Late night.  You?
I could take after Dad, too.
You do --
Me.
What kind of a man are you, son?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Don't bother!
Know so.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
That is my telescope.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for something -- someone.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Yeah --
Thank you. So were you.
That sounds like horseshit.
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
It means you can do anything.
No.
Where?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
What would you do up here?
You planned this --
What about your father?
Yes, one of many.
I'm not applying to college.
No.
I should have told you sooner --
That I want you to take me home.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Either. Both.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Yes.
I want to come back.
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Oh yeah.
Have we ever met before?
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Coming, Eileen...
Well... yeah...
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Why?
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What?
Operator, what's today's date?
What year?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
The power converter...
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
He said not to tell.
What's going on?
Okay.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
They're okay.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Spanish.
I don't know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it would hurt.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
He was nervous.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
I'm serious.
It was going too fast.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
No.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really?
Yes.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
It's mine all right.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Just gimme a chance.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out. In my custody.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Where's the professor?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
The door's locked.
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
A what?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
I want to know!
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Drown all those rascals...
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
A week, eight, nine days –
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
That's all right, really, thank you.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Charlie. How are you.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
You gotta believe me –
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Lou.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
Must be.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Huh?
Uh-huh.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Physician, heal thyself.
Anyway.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Only fry you once.
...Fred...
Bring 1976 up.
It's been three months.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Who?
She said what you said she'd say.
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
Put your hands up!
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
Yes.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I have nothing to hide.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
There's a name from the past.
She wiped out her whole family.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Please.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
To see if he can get away with it.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Of course I knew.
I found Lisa Henderson.
It won't sell.
No thank you.
He was murdered.
How's that?
Cocaine.
What was the weapon?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Do you remember his name?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
I know what that's like.
I went over last night, too.
I feel fine!
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
I'm going with you.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
What about me?
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
We can do better. It needed more white.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
Annina Nosei.
You haven't been by lately.
You name it, I paint there.
How about right now?
Sure.
I'm here.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Yes, but as a black painter –
What?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Use your fucking instinct.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Good. What do you have?
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
You don't have any fucking money..
It's Monday morning.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
What's his name?
You only want one Big Mac?
Me? Why?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
Hi.
Stand still.
Wanna Mac?
Have a Mac.
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Yeah.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
No, actually I feel worse.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I'm -- sorry, I --
...four, five.
We do.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
"We"?  You and...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Photojournalist.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
I'm not scared of you, Max.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
Dad!  Save yourself!
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
That, sir, does not compute.
Coming on line now, sir.
Pheromones?
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
What are you talking about?
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
I hate being lectured.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
He'll be here.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
What?
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
Not good.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I've got to stop him.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
I think they're getting worse.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
Dr. Meridian...
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Mystery.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Tonight's a good night.
Just checking, young sir.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
What's wrong?
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
On occasion. Usually at night.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
Excuse me.
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I'm not-
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Excuse me.
Who is it?
How could I forget?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
... Murderer...
WHICH CAR?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I loathe bats.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Finding out where she is.
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Great. How??
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Meaning?
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
She's ... well, she's good.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
And a car.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
Of course he is.
The TV.
No it wasn't!
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
What's your problem Beavis?
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Me first! Me first!
Me first!
Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Cool, huh huh.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
I see it. I don't get it.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yup. Huh huh.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
We're rich in what really matters.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
How's your arm?
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
Of course I did.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
He might have hurt somebody.
We're ghosts.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
We tried.
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
Yes.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
About what?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
No, wait!
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
No, dummy.  Two.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Just <u>say</u> it.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
I thought I saw something.
Maybe Charles does.
Look at the tiny figures.
I don't know.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
I see.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Thank you, Robert.
In a day or two, yes.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Oh? Certainly...
Hello, Eve.
No. I'm a gardener.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
... Mentor...?
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Oh, good.
I agree.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
No, Ben.
I understand.
Thank you, Ben.
Oh, I see.
A flower...
I like to watch.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
It's very sore.
I agree.
Of course. I would like to look.
Yes.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Thank you.
I see...
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
But you won't sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... Hello.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Try again.
I said - try again.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Good. Anything else?
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Okay.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Malkovich!
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
The monkey.
I... puppeteer.
She's very beautiful.
Right.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You've always loved the animals.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
Holy shit, yes!
Let me try.
I said "yes."
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
You're insane.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I wouldn't know.
No, really.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Maxine.
You married?
Yikes.
No.
What's he been in?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Sure. It'd be fun.
My God.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Says who?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Do we get to wear a crown?
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
I love you, Lotte.
One hour.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
No.
Whatever you're having.
Do you mind?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Lotte called me.
You mean with Malkovich?
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Folks come. Folks go.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I likes yellow.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You remember Halle.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Yes sir
I will.
That was fun.
Might see anything at all at 124.
Better ask Paul D.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
I run him off.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Who is she? Where she come from?
You got to get up from here, girl.
She left me. She's gone again.
She was my best thing.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Make it the way I always do.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Nothing.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
My rug.
Walter, how--
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
What the fuck is he talking about?
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Well--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Different mothers, huh?
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
Separate incidents?
What's your drink, Dude?
On you, maybe.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Mmnun.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
But he's--
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter, he peed on my rug--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
What the fuck are you--
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
No, you're not wrong--
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll--
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Walter, please--
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Whose toe was it, Walter?
But Walter--
Dude--
Huh?
The bulk of the series.
Dude?
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
He can't walk, Walter!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
Wha.
Walter--
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Yeah?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Are you employed, sir?
Dude.
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Help me put him back in his chair.
I said out.  Now.
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
He's half yours, partner.
Someday.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
The House of Pain.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
Nothing.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
You don't have to hunt to do it.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
I'll show you.
Where the hell have you been?
Too bad you're out of it.
Human?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
He was here.  Watching us.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Not that I'm in contact with.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
He didn't. Get over it.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
Like me.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
What are you talking about?
For them. But for me --
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
Go on, I'll be fine!
He killed them?
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
--which she may have--
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Closer.
--my God, Nick???
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
Not the only things missing, Nick.
That's a joke?
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
--Nick!!
What?
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
Why is there no "our" here?
We've looked at half of one tape.
--bullshit!
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
I know, I know.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
--fuckin' A right--
I do.
What?
Yeah?
What're you doing with all this shit?
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
--Cotter: shut up.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Down there in the Park.
How's she going to know where to--
--I saw what I saw.
--Domini!
For "James?"
--a Wiccan--
This isn't about us.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
One of the printers.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
You planning on sleeping out there?
And what's your excuse for being here?
What?
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
I'm sorry.
--a <u>lot</u>.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
--the Sheriff's Office--
No.
I am?
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Meurice--
Your husband.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell happened, Ray?
I think someone's watching.
Remy.
Thanks.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
How long did you watch her?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
For the money.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Of course.
Nah, I trust ya.
You said the usual--
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
What's the point?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
What?
Okay honey.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
You did? A human ear?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Yeah.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
If you want to.
Alright, suit yourself.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
I'll go then.
Yes, I like you.
Who's it, you mean.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Hello.
That's good.
I'm doing it.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Yes.
Beeeee careful.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
No.  Hi baby.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Yes.
Terrible. boring.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Are you sure?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
Okay, Sandy.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Hey Jeff.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Do you want the car?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
He what?
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
You'll see for yourself.
What is?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Nice doing business with you, George.
No fucking way.
Murder.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Because they caught me?
Now do you see what I am saying?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Yeah.  You do the talking.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
What?
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Yes, it is.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
I'll tell her.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
What about him?
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
I like fire.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
I said, I've seen it before.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Are we gonna split up?
How are you doing?
You swear?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
I know, Dad.  I know...
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
I wish there was shit like this back home.
And you believe the NLF?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sid Ahmed.
Second district ...
The NLF has condemned you to death.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
Sure. By shooting at me.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Sure ...
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
A massive cardiac arrest.
No.
Like cats and dogs.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
No.
Rebecca Lawson.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes.
Yes.
We were lovers.
For about one year.
I had bypass surgery.
It didn't.
We stopped seeing each other.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Yes.
Chinese peony root.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
No.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
A.M -- or P.M.?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Then you would have gotten your money?
Sorry.
Yes.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Tonight we open new doors.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
No -- you're not.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Why?
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
I love you too, Dad.
No, Your Honor.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Really?
We have to talk.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
It didn't get there from me.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I know. I don't understand it either.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
No treasure maps, huh?
No. You can have them.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Did we want to?
Oh, yes.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
No.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
After the divorce.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Want another cigarette?
Francesca.
Oh. How old?
No, your kids.
Must be nice having kids.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
She starts sniffing me.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
You want to go back in?
What?
No. I'll do them later.
What?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
No.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Yes! Hi.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Oh, how is he?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Have you ever been to that station?
Near the church.
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
Trouble. Why?
I had a temper.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
No.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
What makes it different, Robert?
Yeah. It could get better.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Later. Go back to sleep.
I'm going to miss you.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Just some flies.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
What it will be.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
Hush, baby.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Then fuck it!!!
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Bill!  Bill?!
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Fuck it.  Alright.
You were just a kid.
Daddy?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
It was just like in my head.
Potential toxic dump site.
That building?
Should I?
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
Evidence of what?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Where's what?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
What the fuck is going on?
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
What are you going to do with it?
What are you talking about?
Why?
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
But it could be anywhere.
The hell I can't!
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Just hurry.
Not until he has the money!
You need the money just like we do.
Sure, Gino, sure.
I should have let him kill you.
I should be going.
Lick me.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Where in the hell is he?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Truck.  Of course.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
No.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
What about that guy this morning?
I suppose he just wants to watch.
I think so, too.
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
Mickey?
...  shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
If he does ...
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
I want a second opinion.
I'm not asking.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So it's time to go home.
We have to go home, Jason.
I don't know.
Look, maybe I should just...
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
-- sir? --
Yes.
Who?  Who came?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Excuse me?
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
You have blood on your pants.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I can't believe I slept.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
I didn't know this would happen.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Who paid the bill?
Nykwana Wombosi. 
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
I can't protect you anymore.
So get the hell out of here.
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
I'm sorry.
Hang on... 
-- I'm on it --
I tried.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
I don't know.
...sabotage!
Layton.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Well, I ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
No, no ... I did that...
Jack!
You remember Alison?
Er, I knew you looked different.
SAM! What a surprise!
Yes, thanks.
How do you mean?
You got the wrong man.
So how ...?
What has Tuttle done?
He's a freelance subversive?
Why?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
We don't make mistakes.
Do you know what you're doing.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Information Adjustments.
No.
Them?
Oh, sorry.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
A heavy Christmas present.
Looking for you.
Suit me?
Well, terrorists of course.
Every day?
Oh God! What have we done?
Oh ... Jesus!
No you're not!
Don't do anything silly.
Information Retrieval.
Don't worry.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
27156789/074328/K.
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
A woman eh? I see.
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I won't be held responsible.
I'm sorry but ...
Um ...
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Er, yes ...
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Have you got one or haven't you?
We'll be back.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
What?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
No. Wait here.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
No ...
Mary ...
Mary said you might be coming.
Got a beer?
I can't hold up my head anymore.
You're going to live.
Dead.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
No way, man.
Yeah?
His heart's beating.
I know him. That's Noel.
At least he's got people around him.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Yes.
He's working a double shift.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Fifteen minutes.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
She's no whore, Marcus.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
What's wrong.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
It's early for him.
Who with?
Why?
Okay, whatta I do?
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
He's drunk.
Relax, will you.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
You sure?
One more time!
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
No?
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
I'll put her on.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Why do you say that?
Sure.
Good night.
Call if you get weird.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Did you shoot their boots?
We can cut back at the end.
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Good.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
Define your terms.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
This isn't friendship.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
You didn't say anything to her?
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
What is she shooting?
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
Yes?
It's started.
We could...
Should I...
Right there, Bobbie.
Bobbie, please.
Follow me.
One's enough.
Nobody else had it.
That's okay.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Honey?...
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
How are you at back rubs?
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
Yes.
What do you mean clean?
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Who?
Great.
Well...
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I know.  I taped it.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Yes.
You fucking...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
I already told you I'm not.
Um...
I'll pose any way you want.
Is the manager cooperating?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
It wasn't easy.
Yes Walter.
Thank you.
Bye!
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
When did you make this, Walter?
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Didn't you hear him?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Well...
I don't have another cat!
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
I-I already got a new one!
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Uh, hi.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Huh?!!!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
Turn around!
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Hiya Maxwell.
Why not?
Really?
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
Then let me give you something then...
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Amazing!
Bummer metaphor.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Yeah, I guess.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Eeyuu.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
It's the news, Buffy.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Hi.
'Bye.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
No, you're not.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
For the dance.
I should have known.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
) What do you think?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Get out of my facial.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
China.
I have to show you.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Cramps?
We wait for Robert to wake up.
She --
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
They were vampires?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
I can't work this.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
They don't even have Dolby.
Thank you very much.
Cassandra's really smart.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Hi.
Oh.
I don't understand.
But --
I heard she got straight A's.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
What is she...
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Okay.
Right!
I don't think so.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Nuke?!
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
You can't seduce me.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
--but you're father's in there!
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
That's my job too.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
You got me all confused.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
Who?
What's so great about baseball?
No.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
He looks great, just great!
Ninety-five miles an hour...
He'll learn.
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
Which one of us?
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
It was a cocksucking call!
But he ain't seen my heat--
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Jesus.
Let go of me!
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
My right.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
Love to--
I ain't hitting a man first.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
Jim looking for somebody.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Good to see ya.  William would you...
He's lying.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
702 472 1862.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
They payin'?
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Nope, there's no way.
Hey, Rich.
I don't wanna come along with you.
I'll be honest with you.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Hey, she came to talk...
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
I -
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Well...
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock.
Good to meet you.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
Yeah, refill'd be great.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
I...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Call security.
What is it?
See you, Ginger.
Hey, Mitch.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, I know all that.
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
It's nice isn't it?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
No, he didn't.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Yeah, how do I know?
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
What do you mean?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
And...
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
Mm.
Who were you with?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
What if he won't stop?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Not gonna let me in?
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
I am calm!
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Mr Rothstein.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
I really think you're -
You're firin' me?
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
Green?
What?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Mm.
Shut your mouth!
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Hi. Good.
Well, I've been busy. 
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
...fuckin' jerk-off.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He tries to do everything...
I'm over here now.
But I'm just trying to leave.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
I know.
I know.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Ma che cazzo!
That's enough now!
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
I'll be right out.
Mm.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Am I right?
It's all right.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Okay.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, you are.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Is that what you want?
A sponsor.
It's what you want?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
Okay, yeah.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
Promise?
You do?
Lester - he called you here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Listen...
They check in alone?
Are they out now?
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Two.
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Get up.
I took care of everybody.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Charlie M.
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Hey.
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
Yeah.
Having a good time?
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
You're probably right.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
I'm sure.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Wha-at?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Why am I still troubled...
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
I got her...
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
I know.
You've seen me...
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
What's the name of your child's best friend?
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
What did--?
Actually, yes.
What?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Trust me, you won't have to.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
Theo wants to talk again.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
I improved on the fucking original.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
You don't understand.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
My name is --
Then hang up!  Do it!
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
Shit!
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Pictures.
A price on everything.
I'm trying to.
The one in Brentwood.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
You're going to let them get away with this?
They put their hands all over me.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
L.A.P.D.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Stop talking like that!
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
259-7881.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Didn't we play this scene before?
Keep talking.
There are no guarantees in this life.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Some loyalty.
Got a phone in that van?
I wish it had never been invented.
Stay there.
It's your call.
Talk to the man.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I still don't see you.
My pleasure --
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
Are you trying to panic the women?
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Who are you?
So who's he?
I'm sorry.
She's not a girl, Col --
Hi, Jimmy.
Saw it, Dil.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
Did I?
It's him, isn't it?
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
He wants to know do I mean that.
She's not a tart.
She's not that either.
What's it to you?
Scottish?
Not me.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
I wonder.
How special?
Must be in love to manage that.
Didn't think I could.
I am.
Where?
Give it over, Dil --
Make it up to me, then.
Are you pretending yet?
Don't be cruel.
Only if you kiss me.
You following me?
More than that.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Yes.
What?
Yes.
I was trying to get out of something.
Only in times of extreme stress.
I will be.
Jimmy?
He asked me to see were you all right.
Let me go, Dil
Let them come then.
Anything.
It's my name, Dil --
Do I?
Please, Dil --
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Need to go across the water.
Do you want some food?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
I heard.
No, what is the thing?
You know what. Go.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Should blow you away, you know that?
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
I can smell her perfume.
Could you?
So I've noticed.
What is it now?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
And you know the funny thing?
She's not my type.
Shouldn't take it personally.
The fastest.
How different?
Give us a break.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I don't know her.
Stop it --
Yeah?
Why?
Stop that talk now --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Got to catch me first --
Hurling --
You didn't?
Tell me, Jody
Who gives a fuck.
Whatever you say, Jude...
You shut your face --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
You're crazy --
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Why do you think I brought you here?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Adam --
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
No!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
We? You mean you're --?
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
May I have a sandwich, please?
So that was it.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
But I don't have it.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Me? Why me?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Yes.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Okay -- up there.
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
It's all right with us --
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
There must be some way.
Which one are you?
Come here.
Okay.
Cutting it out.
Tuesday.
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Shut the door!
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Fiction or non-fiction?
What do you mean?
You mean, you're a thief?
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
I'm afraid it is important.
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
Not unless we're blind.
The kid said --
Tell me what?
I don't know anything.
Stop it!
But his mother --
I'm very confused.
I don't know. I suppose so.
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
We won! We won!
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
Quitter.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
How do you know?
Charles is.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
How do you shave in there?
Where?
How would you like a spanking?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
What are you talking about?
Words can hurt very much.
No -- no, I'm don't.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Ça alors! From Charles?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
How can you tell?
The American Embassy.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Oh la vache!
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
What's wrong?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
No?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I can.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
What?
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
Does she fuck?
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
FINE. Are you?
Stag?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Did Sharon say no?
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
Yeah.
What?
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
You can ask me anything.
Yeah. Who is she?
That's what he said.
The library. I'll be fine.
Who is she?
Why not?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
How could you?
Who were they?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
His mother's side.
Just thinking about something.
I got to go.
I'm worried about someone.
And she didn't?
No, you keep one.
So are you.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
I'm not leaving it here.
Told you to hide it.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
ROD!
...that is going to explode...
Freezer in the back.
 No.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
And if that Elvis shit...
I got, like, uh....
Would you hurry up, please?

Come on!
...all the time.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
Am I missing somethin' here?
God-...

Doesn't work.
Doesn't...

Oh...
All right.
 No...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
 Yeah...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
 Oh...
I know the likeli-...
Come on, old...

...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
Come on.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
These'll keep it cold.

Taking it down the hill.
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
Oh, shit.

You know what I'm sayin'?
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...-er.  It was your friend...
...or my conscience.

We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
 Okay.

Forty-five seven!
Okay.
...our ass!
...here comes the...
Tunnel.
Whoo!
What?
It's working.

Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Who drove the ice cream...
Who had to put a gun to your head?
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
I think so too.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
...within five minutes.
Listen, shithead!
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
You-You can't let him...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...
...including the permanently extreme.
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Is it--?
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
No!
It's too...
Is this stool taken?
You look good, Richard.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...you were right, of course.  But after...
...happen if I drop this?
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
...quick in and out.
Get your links set up!
...here!
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
...time to time, yeah.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
Your fellow hero, untouched...


 ...checked. 

You'd never understand!

I can handle it.
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
You got thirty minutes.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Uh-huh.
...colonel?
Excellent.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
He's brains without ambition...
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Everything will die, Mason.
What?
Forty-seven.
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
I didn't sell the boy any...
...hands!

All right, go.
...-damn phone.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 

BLACK BACKGROUND.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Take it easy, Jake.
That's right.
A ruler?
Thanks.
Probably.
I think I gave it to her.
Do you know him?
Where from?
Honest?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
I've got her.
Yes... I think I can manage...
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Well you own a lot of land.
The apple core club.
Who?
No?
What pictures?
C'mon I'll show you.
Yeah.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
What are you having?
I said I'll drop it.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
A check?
Well, how much would you like?
But he wasn't killed.
How did you find out?
Where you were when your husband died.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
The Valley?
What? What is it?
Get in the car.
Doing what?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
...A flaw...
He owns it. You know?
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
Give me an example.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
What about?
You mean she just found out?
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
I want to see her.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Back to Mexico.
I'm all right.
He's in the dark room.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh, good.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I cut myself shaving.
Only when I breathe.
Si.
...Yes of course.
He owned it.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
I'm working for his daughter.
Why'd she run away?
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Why? What do you mean?
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
Progress! It always arrives too late!
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
So what's that got to do with it?
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
OK...
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Charlie?!
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Of course.
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
In the water.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Well, I -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
Susan, it seems to me -
I'm not sorry.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Can't say, sir.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yes?
Charlie -
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
Look out that window.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
What's wrong, Brad?
Brad, you are drunk.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
I know you will.
Yes.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
What do you mean by that?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Queer?
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Well, thanks a lot.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
What did you get?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
This? How long have you been smoking?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
Can I join in?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
No, don't!
Just now.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
And you said yes?
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
You lie.
But can we date?
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
He's your fiancé.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
I can pass!
I'll assess all I want!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Bunch of savages in this town.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
That's cheating?
Your mother.
Oh yeah.
Blasphemy.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
And the second time around...?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Why not?
I don't back down.
I'm going to miss the game.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Sorry.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Yeah, right.
You've had sex with a dead person.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Yeah, but at what a price.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
You want to rent a movie.
Let me borrow your car.
If you must.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I know I'm your hero.
Because I'm happy.
I'm not. She just left.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
Could be.
Oh, like your life's any better?
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Helluva day.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
Jesus Christ, what next?
Excuse me?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
I'm not dealing.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Meaning?
I'm trying.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
I touched a nerve.
Including you; yes.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three including you.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Please calm down.
Let it go...
Something like thirty-six.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
What time do you get finished?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
I don't want Caitlin...
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Because he's out of shape.
Yeah!
No, I wasn't.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
How long you gonna be here?
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
You're not?
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
I don't know.
So, what do you see?
It can't fly in this weather.
Bags?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Give him the money.
Is it really four thousand?
Okay--I don't know about this.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Just hangin' out.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I don't think you do.
I don't expect you to understand.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
He can handle it.
I only came back for you.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Call me sentimental.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Get it!
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
What?
This rope is sixty years old!
Don't let me fall!
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Forget it!  I refuse!
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Never could save a thing.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
What are you talking about?
It looks like a winding route.
Half a day.
There.  You blind?
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Then it's a deal.
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Kill him when he gets down.
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
Good morning, Walt.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Good evening.
And you, sir?
No. She's dead!
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
How do you do, sir?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Alex.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
No, sir, I feel really great.
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Well, how are you then?
Oh, aye, aye.
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Crabs?
How're you feeling this morning?
But it was horrible.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Yes!!!
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
You have, my son.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Sir.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
You psychic?
Bottega.
How often you go?
Sure thing.
Max...
Yes.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Of course.
I think...
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
What thing?
Oh?
This isn't our goddamn game!
No harm done, ma'am.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
What am I gonna do with flowers?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
What happens if you don't?
Let's not get excited, sir.
I was just tryin' to...to...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
An apology.
You mean like benefits?
It's not that kind of job.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
I'm cool.
With what?
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
I'm trying...
It's not me.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Who was he?
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
How?
Believe it.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I'm not catching a melody.
You mind?  I'm working here.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
What difference does it make?
Oh, I'm captivated.
What happened?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
Why?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Some living.
What happened to you?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
None of your business.
Slow down.
Vincent?
Let her go.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
I can't promise you anything.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
I'll see you tomorrow.
For what?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Yeah.  I think so.
Do they have a secret handshake?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
You're certifiable.
Surprise me.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Is he dead?
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
They're big details, Jerry.
What?
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Not today.
What's in Connecticut?
Did you kill him?
Because he believed me.
They'll trace it.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Top pocket...  Go on.
You think it's a conspiracy?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
Terminal?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
You do recognize it then?
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Not today...
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
What the hell does that mean?
And Jonas?
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Tell me.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
No doubt.
David --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
What?  Why?
With me.
Are you threatening me?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
I don't understand.
Good luck, David.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
How soon will you be able to decode it?
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
It's beautiful.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
And a hundred mile airspace.
I can't move any smaller.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Many others.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
That's my girl...  Lights.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
Any luck on the grant money?
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Jesus --
Peter.
Like it or not.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Now you know.
Can you try?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
What'd you think?
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
The final countdown.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Please --
-- I don't know --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
In other words.
Meaning...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
Have your department make a full report.
We work down in the ditch?
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
Gotta go, Arletta.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Hey, Tattoo!
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
He's gonna be awright.
A Lucas Jackson.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
I just always did like truck rides.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Thass right. Just play it...
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Damn.
Well, how far didya get?
No. No chains either.
What did I do?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
But </u>alive</u>!
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
You already made the delivery?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Who was the man in the basement?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You know where.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Then what do you need me for?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
Not yet.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
I'll get a locksmith.
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Oh, I know.
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Just horseshit luck.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
Honest to God, Ruben!
Let's get out of here...
Look at him, grandstanding...
Helen... excuse me, we...
Shut up.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
You got a suspect...
Give me Ruben back...
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
It is?
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
It does.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
One of your suitors?
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
No.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Really?
She said she'd be here at 10.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Do you think I should?
Oh, no, of course not.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
You've only known Jake a few months.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
A deal's a deal.
Who do you think you are?
I wasn't hungry.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Enough with the abracadabra.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Exactly.
Don't be ridiculous.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Open up.    I want to see.
I'll see you tonight.
Yeah?
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
You got wine. That's great.
Bingo.
Always the drugs.
Why'd you tell?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
Can you loan me a 20?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
I've met someone else.
Here's the ring.
Oh.
I start on Monday.
I heard about your friend.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on is phone?
It's Daniel.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
He missed three weeks.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
We can't.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Where are you from?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
What for?
We'll think of something.
No.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
Do I?
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
No?
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
What?
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Good song though.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
I see.   A master criminal.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
I'm the driver.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Yeah, I can see that.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Mr. Taylor?
Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Oh, you think?
Wait here.
And you don't speak French?
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
No.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
A little?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Long.
He is my defeated foe!
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I have a guest.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Really?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
You're probably right.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Give it back!
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
But Wudan does not accept women.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
We must avenge mother!
Father!
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
I'm buying.
No further.  I'm serious.
Fucking A, my friend.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
I'm sorry as hell, man.
How 'bout the morgue?
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
No.
I have to go.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
Mom tried to cook.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
T-Bird?
I can see her.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Does it hurt?
Your pain ends now.
Very well, it's your ass.
18k.  Crap.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Junior.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
What? Another letter from your friend?
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Refreshing.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
Yes.
Wait, don't hang up.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Okay.
Oh please.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
No.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I think that's for the best.
Hi.
It was perfect.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Any ideas who it could be?
Greg McConnell.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
I don't think that bothered him.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Okay.
Why?
Best friends.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I do.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
It works a little.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Get out of here.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
And you think she bought it?
No.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Likewise I'm sure.
It's Kathryn.
No.
What?
Sounds intriguing.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Okay.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
But who will they turn to for help?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate it too.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Take a look for yourself.
With who?
Kind of.
No, I'm not.
I have a flair for drama.
I accept. Now get out.
Get out!
It's Cecile.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Annette! Annette!
We played backgammon?
I did?
Oh... no thank you...
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
What's her name?
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
What?
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
I suppose so.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
Yes, daddy.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
They ran away.
It was just a voice.
Daddy, it's true.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But...
Yes, darling.
You called me by my name.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
But she's such a nice lady.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
No, thank you.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Look at me.
My daughter died long ago.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
That's from her -- that woman.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
And Amy mailed them?
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
I mean where on your body?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Nearly four.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
So don't look in his eyes.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
You're just saying that.
And she got the medium.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
No you don't, believe me.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
You should have seen it erect.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
Frida? You okay?
Starving.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
They say sex is great for cramps.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Take your shower.
On your desk.
On your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No. I was doing my laundry.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
Interesting possibility.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
They do? Oh no...
What? Is there someone else?
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Oh my god, what happened?
You got a dog?
Packages of money.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
We only live a few blocks apart.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
This one walk you home too?
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
What makes her think that?
And that was 28 days ago today.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
He tried to kill me!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.  This way.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Patricia Crenshaw.
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Iím sorry...
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Who?
Don't know much, do you?
What?
No.  Have a look.
It must be a closet or something.
Then we must call the police.
Yes.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
I have to go...
No, it's the truth.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
We are...  living in their dreams...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
No more than the usual.
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Don't worry about it.
A month.
Great.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
I mean,  if it's a problem...
What the hell is this ?
No...
Great.
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
Bob...
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Oh.  Excuse me.
I don't think so.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
He's not.
Really?
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
Well...
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Mind if I sit down?
Home.
You1re leaving, too?
What?
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
Yeah... It could be fun.
We're working on it.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Leave him.
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
The tunnel.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
Quiet!
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Gasparilla?
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Ain't no place safe.
Maybe.
We got a boat.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
What you wanna do?
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
I don't think they're in school.
Knox Overstreet.
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
Hey, this is great.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Knox, you gotta calm down.
Well?
So you really think she means you're going with her?
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I'm sorry.  I, we
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Sure.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
My Word
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
A crazy madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
I don't know.
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
But different.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
I'll take him over mine.
Nothing.
Found what?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Quiet.  I have to think.
I'll come to the performance.
Do you have to quit the play?
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
What the hell are you talking about?
And where is our point of arrival?
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
Shut up!
Anti social?
Right... You have a boat.
You should talk...
What?
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
No...
Forget them...
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
I don't know...you got what we need?
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Joey...
A passenger...
You want some too?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Maybe plans changed...
Hey! Come out here!
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
Yeah.
Those are mine!
What?
Good... Pass the beer.
Fuckin' A!
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
They did not!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
She does not!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
But I insist.
Yeah?
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Psst. Vince!
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Sal's alive???
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Oh... You know...
Would you?
I don't know! I don't know either!
Sure.
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
What?
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I... No. You do this for money?
Playing.
Right here.
There's Vince!
Huh?
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
Hell no!
Huh?
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What do you think?
Merle...
More bullets in the gun?
What do you mean, no???
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
What?
No.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Phantom Mary?
Aw, it's a long story!
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
Yeah.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Down.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Remember my promise.
Go in the house.
Yes.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
How do you know?
Yes.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
I was set up.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
I'm here.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
Hospital food.
I'm signing off.
They always are.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
Good to know you, Willy.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
This little thing says I can't.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
No! No! I won't.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
No. She's gone.
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Well -- yes --
Oh, Jabez.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Jabez ...
Jabez!
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
I don't know, Jabez.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
It don't matter!
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Sure, Ma.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Mary -- Jabez --
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
I'll do my best, Mary.
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
Married.
But meant her moving here.
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Mind if I play some tunes?
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
Okay.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
I'm a cop from New York.
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
I'm going to count to three...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Roy?
Bullshit.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
No.  I never smile any more.
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
You don't have a choice?
Are they on the phone still?
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
Oh no!
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
Call me whatever you want.
I frisk you?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
What do you want?
They were ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Come on, lemme load you up...
It's all we got.
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Give me the keys...
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
Well, they go to guard school.
Sure - we like you.
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
I'm glad it's okay.
Yeah.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
What?
I want him to think that.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
All right ... send them the guard.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Wyoming.
Everybody!  Back here!
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
Yeah - it looks real official.
I said you were never a faggot.
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
On a raid. If she wants to see justice... we gonna take Domino to the Jungle, baby. <b> EXT. JUNGLE -- NEXT </b> The El Camino pulls into the entrance to the JUNGLE. The neighborhood of LOW INCOME HOUSES winds upward into the HILLSIDE adjacent to the wall. Ed parks the El Camino next to the curb. <b> INT. EL CAMINO -- NEXT
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
What?
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b>
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
In theory.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Real good.
Nobody.
<i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i>
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
You got my back.
My brother.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
You a troublemaker?
You're welcome.
We're still standing.
That's it?
Wake up!
It's gonna be hot today.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Yeah, me too.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Whew!
Look at that.
What?
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Him no white.  Him no white.
Run it then.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Can't do.
Where we goin'?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Your memory is really getting bad.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
It's 'pose to be cold.
I am a man.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
What?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
We're outta here.
I was going to buy a slice.
I understand.
He's nuts.
I ain't getting shit.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Good.  I want you to listen.
I like Mookie a lot.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Whaddup?
Tell 'em, Pop.
Don't start on me today.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Actually we have something for you.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Yeah. How'd you know?
HARRY Dunne.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Come over around seven.
Yeah...
I'm fine.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Okay, what?
Right.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
I go to school where I live.
Why not?
No.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
You brave soldier.
Go fish.
Sounds like a pirate.
Peg leg?
Exactly! A pirate!
She did not.
Will not.
Shut up!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
And he invented fire.
They can't be real.
Put some ice on it.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Our own special bus.
Sucks for you.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Yea!
Hey, where did you come from?
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
A blimp.
Who?
Am not.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
Hey, where'd you go?
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
I know, you want go for a ride.
Oh, go on.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
That's the downside. There is none.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Or maybe crossing a river!
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
Yes you are. 
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
We start our own class?
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Yes!
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Piter.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Is this what you seek?
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Paul!!  Paul!!
My Lord?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Excellent!
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
I can't... I can't.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
You feel the flesh crisping?
Where?
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
It's a pleasure...
No.  I never drink -- wine.
I predict we're lost.
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
Don't you bave a car?
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Who do I play?
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
I never said I could ad-lib...
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Rolling.
This is the big moment...!
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
And who may you be?
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
We'll do our best.
What?
You got the job?!!
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Toss us out on our ass.
That's ridiculous.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Hruphh...?
Would that work?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Yes?
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Yes?
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Who?
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Oh.  Congratulations.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Okay?
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
The sun.
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
What's uncanny?
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
What octopus motor?
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Mr. Wood!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
No! Do they show you having sex?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Yeah. Ma...
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
This is real, Bananahead!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Cool.
No, uh...
What if Shari's the dream?
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
We're falling behind.
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Oh my God!!
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
He says --
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
And what did he come back now for?
What's the matter?!
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
No, I mean...
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Welcome to work, Ed.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
The what?
Oh yeah.
Why?
... yeah, then, but...
Really? 
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Come on...
No. It's your fault.
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What is?!
You're in show business?
We're excited.
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Oh, Jesus.
You watching the ballgame?
Please!
I know.
Save it.
Me?!
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Hi.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Sure.
Good?
Ed?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Here, get down.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
I know.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
That sounds good.
Take as much room as you want
Walt needs to see you.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
I did it.
This weekend.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Should we get a what?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Three twenty-five.
Sherry... I love you.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
I also like bananas.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
I don't care.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Sure, Tracy.
What'd I do?
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
Yes.  But do you know?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
It's Lynn.
You fuck for money.
Yeah.
So tell me about it.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Look at a picture for me.
No!  Please leave!
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Clean?
Say what and so what.
I never truck with no sissies!
But you were business associates?
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
I want you to follow Bud White.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Right now, before I back down.
What's Dudley's scheme?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Under the house.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Yeah.
Something like that.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
I don't know what that means.
Told by whom?
Really?
Who was that other guy?
What do they have to do with this?
The NSA?
Wait.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
One-twenty.
Look, my wife is understandably--
You told me no calls.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Jesus.
Looks like Detroit.
Who?
Those are Feds.
That wasn't so hard.
What if--
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
How fast can you learn?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
What are you saying?
Neil, thank you for your help.
You got any money?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Pardon?
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Just for the criminals.
Something bad happened tonight.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
What do you mean?
It's okay.
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Just reporters.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
You opened the thing?
Don't count on it.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
It's how he works.
Yes.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
All right, look--
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
Bullshit.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
We'd rather not--
Merry Christmas, son.
Brill.
Hi, dad.
Really?
Do I know you?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
They only took electrical appliances.
Into what?
Calm down.
You're tired.
To the cops?
I have a family.
Yeah?
The police?
He got hit by a bus.
Get it.
He had help.
You're kidding me.
What about the tape?
Do you have visual?
What's your ETA?
Puffed cheese?
Yes sir.
I don't care to bargain.
Excuse me.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
You don't sew at all!
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
You will.  You will.
What?
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
We've got to get you out of here.
Don't talk.
I know.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Sorry, what's your point?
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Right.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Thank you.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
I don't know.
Don't cut me.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Are you Hana?
So was my Patient.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
Off with his head!
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
I'm fine.  I got hot.
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
To arm-twisting.
Candaules
Yes.  Dropping off.
I can already see.
Yes?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Why?  Is he staying?
I've been told that before.
Thank you.
Of course.  When?
Then come with me.
He can't even move.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
A toddler
He's sleeping.
I had a hotel room.
I'm feeling old.
This is making me incredibly angry.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
I don't think so.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
How about if you try disappearing.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Then don't.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Uh, yes.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I sincerely hope so.
So what?
No. Why would I be?
Well, no...but...
Possibly.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Can you follow simple directions?
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
I never carry...baggage.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
It was a long time ago.
Little celebration before we set off.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Ready.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Okay, 80-20--
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
My job, my rules.
Where the money is.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You've thought of everything.
We're doing it tonight.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
Surgically attached.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
FUCKING THING!!!
Get out of here!
I'm not leaving without you.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
This is big enough.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You know where my loyalties lie.
I figured that out.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
Who?
Which one?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
What's your point?
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
For what?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars.
Any school you want.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Course I did.
So you think we got 'em scared?
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
I know how DNA works, Erin --
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
Uh-huh.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
You're not gonna be there.
Erin?  What are you --
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Take it.
Yesterday.
That's right.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
It happens all the time.
Well I hate it.
I'm gonna go live with George.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
You got more than one?
Ten?
You got a little girl?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
How?
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
I need it.
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
That's okay.  I understand.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Uh-huh?
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
You won't.
Everyone's invited, of course.
What's wrong with him?
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Why?
Where?
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
You look great.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Repairs ...
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
You may call me Leia.
Not really.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
That sounds familiar.
Well, what now?
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Free your mind and return he will.
It is the future you see.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
If it must be.  Yes.
Time will tell.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
And we can watch ...
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
He's a gorilla.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Go on now. Do as I say.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Where?
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Dream on, blue eye.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
I don't know yet.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
Having second thoughts?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
A medical team will be standing by.
No.
Lock fuel rods.
Where'd they go?
We'll see.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
I'm looking for somebody.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
Move aside!
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
...of course...
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
Rise, Mordred.
So be it.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
You, my lord.
You.
--Nothing!
We are to blame.
I will run.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Can it truly be used for magic?
I'm not jealous!
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
I see, your excellency.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
In here!
What's this?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
What didn't he tell you?
What is it?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Please.
What's her name?
You're a nice man.
All right then we've got clean rats.
Yes, I go now.
Karl!!
What man?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Yes, I think so.
Depression?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
And those lies she's been telling?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
He didn't mention her.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Why, I don't understand?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
What's the difference?
What?
Father?
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
The closet
Yeah.
I wouldn't talk.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Well I heard differently.
Honey it's to help you.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
I stole it.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
Stealing is a sin.
What's playing.
Who's in it?
I'm not Regan.
In here. With us.
It would bring us together.
Who are you?
How's your leg?
No.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Defender of the human race...
Her heart.
Don't listen.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
What's this about?
I once did a paper on it
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
That's to bad.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Be silent!
It's our goddamn car!
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
They're falling out.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
Get your hand off me.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Two nights.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Lotta water.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
It's more than that.
I don't gotta go.
You'll see.
What do you mean?
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
What?
Terrific.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I'll drop the eighths.
It's not gonna hurt you.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
I'll take my chances.
Right.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
A few bars!
Yeah.
Christ, can't you hear it?
Doesn't it matter to you?
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
Yeah.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Twenty-eight years.
I don't know. Some disease.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
I'm sorry?
Blanche.
Yes, it is.
Don't take it personally.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Am I missing something?
Time for what?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Piece of cake.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Virgins.
Yeah.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
Huh?
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Huh?
I'll call you.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
He doesn't bite.
The name's Baker --
Downstairs.
Nothing personal --
Every year.
In and out.
Guess I got a little scattered.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
I'm not upset.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Sure.
He called her.
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
Oh.
Coffee?
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
No.
What are they?
Yeah?
Merry Christmas.
I'm not much for sweets.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Shut up.
For what?
Must've been after we got engaged.
And you wouldn't be.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
Not anymore.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Shoot him!
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Like you know anything about it.
You mean like ... condoms?
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
No problem.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Normally, I would.  But today ...
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
-- I've got to study.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Call me spontaneous.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Sure.
Big Ed’s.
That’s where you work.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
Pretty much.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
I’ve got all the time in the world...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Everyone needs something.
What the hell is happening to me?!
How much time?!
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Get out, I call 911.
It would help me if we were.
Thanks.  To you too...
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Uh huh...
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
All in one tape?
You hear me complaining about that?
I was in the city.
Because that’s where I live.
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
You’re kidding me...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
And...?
Do what?
She got those shoes...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I want it...
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Are you sure?
And now...?
But you always seem so certain.
That’s a big one for me, too.
I’ll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
It’s good to see you...
Not with what they pay me...
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Okay, I’ll take them...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
So we'll get egg nog.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
If it's something you feel strongly about.
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I like the sound of that.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Go back to the drawing board.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What about you?
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
But all these people...
So are you!
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
Dude.  That's my sister.
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
And if he's not...?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Sure.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Passion.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
You <u>were</u>?
I gave him twenty.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Phase Two.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
The less time, the better.
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
And take a little trip with them...
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
At an operation?
How are you, Miss Peterson?
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
Where we going?
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
I could use a lawnmower...
On the Repeater.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
No Jean, no money!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Yeah.
Jezhush.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Oh, geez.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, but this TruCoat -
You have children?
Oh, now he's adorable.
I unnerstand.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh - in what way?
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Uh-huh.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Uh-huh.
Yah, right -
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Ya got the car?
Okay.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah.
Yah.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Ah, dammit!
Well, I don't vouch for him.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Call 'em up.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Aw, Norm.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
No, no, that's fine.
Well, they're a good outfit.
I'm sorry, Mike.
It's okay, Mike...
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Three-cent stamp.
It's terrific!
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well... Why don't we...
Right, right.
He was killed in action.
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Oh.
Some of it, yes.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Yes?
Does this sound strange to you?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I don't know -- am I?
The girl had done her homework.
Should we?
You haven't been going to yours.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
Good.
Nothing.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I'm sorry, but I...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
What do you want me to do?
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
This is how we fill up our lives.
And, now it's gone.
...no ...no ...
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
A hotel?
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Yes, you can.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
You get the idea.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Call what off?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
Any historical figure.
He was obviously able to handle it.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Yes, I promise.
I said I promise!
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
We don't... ?
Work.  Going to work.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Homework assignment.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
What should I have told you?
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
... is over.
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I'm you?
I don't know!  Tell me!
I'm not going...
If you know, I know.
I quit.
I swear on my life, I won't...
Very good, Sir.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
It's free to all.
No, please, no, God, no!
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
I hope you're ready for this.
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Taken care of.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
What was the fight about?
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I know.  I can feel it too.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Who am I, David Blane?
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
Nice try, kiddo.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Thirty-nine.
Like... 4:25.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Easy, Billy, just open it.
I know who you are.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Start over.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
No.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Let me see.
I suppose you have...
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
You think you are... .
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
What's the plan?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
About 22 hours on site.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
I know.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
Can you walk?
Colonel.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Do I look like I have someone special?
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
Really?
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
The moron?
And who's Lydia?
Well, what the hell does that mean?
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
How have you been?
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Where?  Maybe we can.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
I... I was just leaving.
Fine.  I'll say no.
No, I have to work.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Tonight!  How's tonight?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Great place huh?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
They work for Him.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
You don't have to say that.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
You have a disease.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
You said.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
I'm not.
I hope they do.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Shut up! All of you!
No.
Who said I was depressed?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Okay...
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
No.
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
You know who it once belonged to?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Who's Van Oost?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
Don't tell me about this...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
That's dangerous, you know.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Then after that?
Tomorrow, then.
The day after tomorrow.
I gave it a second thought.
Thank you.
Shut up...
That's what you said?
What?
I'll be back later...
Yes.
Is she?
That's what I mean...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Jesus, what a rude person...
That's an old maid's tale.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Is it true?
I'm wit' Carlos.
Wussup.
You got a boyfriend?
I can't!
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
C'mon.
Which one?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
She didn't say she had no man.
Your friend must be misinformed.
What?
So, then whadda ya want?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Sonofabitch.
I have no idea.
Fletch, this is dumb.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
Can I ask anybody now?
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Thank God, the police.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
We play tennis at the club.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Your aunt?
Well, which one?
Just relax....
Okay. Some idea.
Fletch...
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You don't have a piece of the action?
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
My lawyer was a bum.
I'd have been long gone.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Course he has. That's his wife.
What are you doing here?
No problem.
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Charmed.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Sure, all drifters do.
Sure.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
So were my parents.
Hi.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Why did you do it?
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
That's what I want to know.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Very good, sir.
Sierra del fuego.
What?
Who are you?
This morning.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
John!
No, I ain't got you...
Who's your decorator?
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you...
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
No prob...
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Johnny's C.D.?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
Why are all these people after me?
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Are you okay?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
No - no.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Yes --
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Encore du sho ping!
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Pour moi?
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
What happens to the schedule?
But will they?
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
He got off on six.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Strike out, eh?
Who's on him?
Not a chance.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
You remember Mary Finelli?
You know what I'm saying.
Well, I think you do.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Elvis has left the building.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Hello, Frank.
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
How's that?
Daddy, I'm scared.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Queens, New York.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Uh huh...
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I don't know.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Yeah...I think so.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Fire.
It did, Pop.  It did.
October 12, 1969.
Chief?!  Is that you?
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
October 22, 1969.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
You there?
H-hi.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
What's wrong?
Sully!  Is that you?
Better.
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Yeah, that's right.
She's pretty special.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Will you come with me?
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Is that so bad?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
You promised you'd never ask me.
Sort of.
Why don't you help us?
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Keep looking.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I have to.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Sheriff, you better take this.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
I could swear I heard...
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
My ass.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Okay.  There's one.
'Cause it stinks.
Wait a minute. I just...
I hope so.
No more.
Are they grown-ups?
Who ya calling?
We'll scare 'em right back.
But what I get scared again?
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
Please don't do anything crazy.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
The what?
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Do you have to ask?
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Oh my God, Steven.
I'm now begging you.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
You don't know shit!
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Perfectly.
They're out of town.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
Where is she?
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I...I can't...
Just felt a little chill.
Really?
Yeah...a lot.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
What is your location?
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
I'd love to.
Please, hurry...
Very big.
Very bad today.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
She wants a divorce.
What do I exude?
That was a big mistake.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
There are things that speak to us from the past.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Paisley Porter.
Did you see the winning run score?
Let's work on it.
Does what feel comfortable?
I talked to her two days ago.
Our Peter?
Can he get through it?
They'll lose because they're my team.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Why do you need a radio?
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Daddy, wait.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Yes.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
How prominent?
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
I'd forgotten that.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I'm glad we're having this talk.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
Life is good.
I'm at the door.
It's me. Nicky.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
They're only gonna lose.
Since when did that matter?
So what are you going to do about it?
Washed away.
Because faith is rewarded.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
I have excellent long-term memory.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
A little drastic maybe?
Is what true?
Where are you going now?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
He goes to the theater armed.
Are you sure?
Some of it good, I hope.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
Well, we shall try.
No, no -- just a moment, please.
I thought you were against fighting.
It was one incident.
Panditji -- please, help me.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
I hope not.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
No.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
I dined at the prison.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
Now is your chance to find out.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Where do we start?
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
What a relief.
Thank you, no.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
You know I'm scared of heights.
Any particular reason?
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
In case you get back before I do.
Antonio, the choir...
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Why not?
I've found him too.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Why would we do that?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
I bet.
Get it over with...
Assumed name... Houston.
Whisky and a peach.
It's all right.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
Why, there's nothing on the news?
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
I don't see how.
What's wrong?
Who was it?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
We walk.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Okay. How many bank exits?
What about the vault?
Whatever you need.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
He took the day off.
Just fine.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
How about twenty thousand?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
I'll tell you when.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
How?
When did you find out?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
I know.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Why?
That's nice.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
I can't Jack. How can I?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
I can't.
No.
Really?
Nasty.
Brumby.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Not entirely. No.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
They said he was drunk.
What?
Why would it?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
How many?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Ta-ra.
What about Keith?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
Yes, thank you.
Not much.
Jack Carter.
That's all right, Eric.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Still got your sense of humour.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
That's right.
...they hold on to their money...
To get on the...
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
They came in and they, you know...
They killed the goose.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
Nurses.
What?
You...
What? 
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Did you talk to Graff?
For five thousand?
You're saying "me."
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
Because you listened.
What do you care...?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
What?  You can't do any what?
They're ancient.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole the...
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
...what am I going to do all month...
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
No.
Where was I?
Where did Moss...?  I...
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
Thank you, George.
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
That they're going to be upset.
The leads come in, I'll let...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Would you excuse us, please.
Levene!!
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Could I...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...you didn't close...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
Moss.
Murray...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Either way.  You're out.
What if you don't close...?
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Somebody broke in.
What does that fucking mean?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
What?
Was it?
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
I'm sorry.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
That's right.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
What is it?
Yes.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
What do I...?
Gimlet.
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
If we wait till Mon...
You tell me again.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I don't have the power.  I said it.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
Not to my knowledge, no...
Fuck the Machine.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
I'm going home.
Yes.
You did?
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
Yes.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I'm not hungry.
How are the kids?
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
He will grow strong.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
Mio fratello.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was hard to have him killed.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
But, you told me yourself...
What do you want me to do?
And you believed that story.
I've always taken care of you.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
I'm going to see my parents.
Kay... Kay...
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
That plane goes to Miami...
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Twenty-five this time.
Tom, what do I do now?
Very well.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
The witness is excused; take him out.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Sleeping inside me.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
You would have killed his brother?
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Michael.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
Yes.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
I deny his every charge.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
And?
Sitting right behind you.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
I'm not a kid.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
You will not hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
What do I do?
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
What did she mean by going flooey?
Huh?
Football in college.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Your family ate dripping?
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
What happened?
Cut it out!
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're talking through your hat now.
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Good.  Let's get dry.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
But you said --
I see.
Not at all.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
Yes.  Perfectly.
So what do I do?
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Oh dear.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
How ya doing?
Yes ... Kip ...
I don't want him hurt...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
How is he?
You know my back -
How's Atley -- ?
Get out of here, then. Now.
You know my back.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
You know my back.
Double-meaning intended --
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
Keys were in it ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
And there she is --
Dignity...
There's no one left ...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
You, too, Ma...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
What time of year?
You guys are through...
Yeah... You want a ride...
Don't go there, Toby --
About what?
Me...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
I'm cool.
What?
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
I understand -
Oh. Okay. Right.
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
No worries ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
What's that?
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
You sure I can't go with ya?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Nods again.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
I'm in construction.
What bag?
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
How much?
That again.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Shit.
Let her carry this shit inside.
I can't do it anymore.
You know. The stuff I left.
I got scared.
What?
Jimmy.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
He heard.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Tommy  ...
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
He's with his friends.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
I don't want them left back.
But, Paulie, please.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
What? Come on!
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Why not?
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
I told you, I just got change.
Retainer...
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
Seven.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
Yeah, can I help you?
Which one's your building?
What're you doing?
Really?
That's right.
Half-red, half-black--
--Half-red, half-black--
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I did.
Good to see you.
I got your card.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
I won't talk first.
I think so.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
--I'm not angry at you--
He's not you!
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
What's the point?
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
--Well, maybe that means you.
Haven't called her.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
No, I don't.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
I didn't want the job.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
It sure ain't good.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Good luck.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Yes you were.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well...
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
I'm supposed to understand this.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Some, a little.
Like me?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
What's it to you?
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Sure, but what is this?
Joad.
Two.
Why ain't they more like it?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Goodnight.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
That's our place.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
Women is always tar'd.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Take her with you!
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
Ya say we're acrost?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
They killed Casy first.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
He was a good man.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
But who done it?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
California, here we come!
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
We gonna stay, ain't we?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
I wisht it was day.
Man bones?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
In the corporate offices.
Don't say that.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Then express yourself, Bob.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Overflowing with love.
Yes.
It's nice to see you again.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Yep.
That'd be good.
I'll think about it.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Like heroin?
Like love?
No.
It's something I do...
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
I'll hide.
I just know.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
Up on the right.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
That sounds pretty interesting...
--Nooo--
If he does our job, he's our job.
He didn't.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
That's wonderful, Mom.
It's a place where religious people--
Jim?
Nature made him then broke the mold.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
That's good.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Does Chicago count?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
It is. It's lovely.
Annie!
Fine!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
What about him?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Whatever you want.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
No, you just act like you do.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
You're right. Good.
Tom?
I said... I started.
Good.
Who's there?
All right. Speak to you then.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
We're very lucky.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
Yeah.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
Everything all right.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
I don't understa-
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
What do you mean?
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Oh, how sweet.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
What?
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
That's what some folks say.
Weekend after next...
I don't think Warren would go for that.
He thought it was a ghost.
She's an editor.
Sure.
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
You just showing off for her!
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
What is it with this guy?
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
I want it.
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
It was him, man!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Go fix the phones.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
I'm taking over a TV network.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
What's this one eat?
Joey's getting stupid busy.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
If I win, you become my slave.
You're not gonna win.
Do my ears deceive me?
It's my subway defense system.
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
You would have looked better.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Homicidal?
Gill.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Congratulations.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
555-4202.
Real charmer.
This morning.
No, you don't understand.
We've been better.
What does that mean?
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
It's okay..it's okay.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
About what?
How many people in the bus?
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Like a real sister?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
I don't want to.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
Yeah, hurry up.
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Oh Rachel!
All right.
Jamie?
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
No problem, Sheriff.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Car trouble?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Now you understand?
You blame everything on kids.
Huh?
He shouts, too.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
I have a place for that.
Why did you hang up on me?
Of course.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
He can still watch.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
No, he's not.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Lee Brackett.
I'll be here.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
He isn't a man.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
Totally.
There is no such thing.
There was no one outside.
What did he look like?
I'm scared...
Let's make more popcorn.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
You're coming with us...
Will you get her for me?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
I'm wasting time.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Mm-mm!
Are you really interested?
Well, let's do it.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Right.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
I'm an architect.
What time do you get off?
Yeah.
And it ruins everything else.
When did you first notice this?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
I don't know exactly.
Ohhhh!
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Oh, God.
Yes?
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
No, I don't have time.
No?
Well, sure.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
What do you expect me to say?
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
I know it isn't.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Are you angry with me?
Always.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Oh, honey!
No, thank you.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Because I have to!
No.
Jesus...Jesus!
You know... 
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
Okay.
You look so beautiful.
Why?
How are you?
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I got two minutes.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Football!
Is there no chance?
Well, then a third opinion.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
True.
No, no, we decided!
Oh, sure.
Will you just tell me one thing?
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh?
Singing?
Really?
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Yeah, that's clerical.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I recall you.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
I am.  You-you made my day.
Hi.
Okay.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
God.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
I have not read you your rights.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Then who's buying it?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
I'm not.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Impossible.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
The children...?
I won't take much of his time.
Exactly.
Try Barney Clark.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Shut up, Starling...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Said what?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
She my foster.
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Is it necessary to know?
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
<u>Yes</u>.
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
...<u>what</u>...?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
And why should we believe you?
What shape is the scar?
Dottore Fanelli...
...yes, yes, yes....
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...no...
...would you use a small word?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
What is your point?
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Say Hi for me.
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
Wha-at?  What is it?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]

Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
Yeah. And?

Ronnie!
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
I'll think about it.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Color me nauseous.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Very very. The photographs?
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Yeah, maybe.
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Uh-huh.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Yeah, great.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
Incredible similarity.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Remember he's left-handed.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Let's kick his ass.
Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
Superb.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
is very angry.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
hurries over.
Thank you so much!
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Mummy!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
What??
That idiot boarder?
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
You mean travel by ourselves?
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
Yes . . .
All right, then.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
I'm stumped.
Second most common?
Eighty third most common.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Well?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
What was it?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Just get better okay?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
What?
Really? Do tell.
How much time off?
Someone special.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
I've been in here before.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Uh... eighty two?
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
This isn't happening.
What?
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
I don't work here.
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Me!
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
What picture?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Uh, no.
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
Bodybuilding!
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
Said he's not an actor.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
She can't quit.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Never reach out!
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
So this really does the trick, eh?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
-- a sense of proportion.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Just show me the way.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Uh huh.
Holly -- that's not so.
I've asked him what's wrong.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
What?
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
What?
All new houses have noises.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Where should I hide the car keys?
Philip!  The senior partner?
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
Shut up.
Do you have enough money?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
And I can't help having a cold.
-- A man.
Get on the other side of that.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
It's a double.
Would you?
Not now.  I'm busy.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
We don't have any proof of that.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Central Park.
Around.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Most people are afraid of death.
Aye.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
That's all?
That is what bothers me.
For what?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
Living.  Remember?
No -- I will.
No -- after you.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Aye.
You got me.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Because it's my name.
I don't know anymore.
Then how did he know your name?
You look like you have.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Conner?
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
How could they get by him?
I know, Paul.
I like my work.
We'll see.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
This cannot be.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Fine.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Yes, sir.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
He knows better than that.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
I'm going to my desk.
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
You can't run with suitcases.
I overheard him with the girl.
Keeps to himself, more like.
I don't eat junk food.
You said they would be here!
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
You sure?
I know.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
These disks . . . where are they?
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
Your phony FBI assholes.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Let me explain.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
How many in your family?
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
What did they say?
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
The high command? Our high command?
“Well rewarded” Those were his words.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
I'll be over.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
Today.
No, sir.
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
For supplies, you drive.
I saw the sign.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
I will give you my house.
Of course.
The third floor are low class rooms.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
He wants your wisdom.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Murdered! By whom?
Dawn. Then they go.
Get in.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
What about us?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
So where is the lamb?
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
Go out! Where?
You cannot go alone.
A kiss.
What?
What sort of car?
I want to know.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
Paul! Then another voice.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
There is one thing I need right away.
Why?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Can I help you?
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Not at all!
Yeah, me too.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
What?
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Take the gun.
I'm better than that.
Most fun I've had all day.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- listen to the man --
-- was that??
I hope not.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Where is she?
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
No, no, it's just --
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
I can't remember at the moment.
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Blackburn's dead.
He must've unsealed the room!
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
It might have been her mother.
What will they tell you?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
That poor little girl.
Sure.
Well I bet you they're happy.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Yes.
We'll get it later.
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Sure.  Did you see the others?
He's blessing the house.
Well, that all depends.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
Yes, I am.
Did you know her very well?
It was a shame.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
So what should we do, father?
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Good night.
The amulet...
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Yes, they are.
What?
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Right.  Right!
Right.
Sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
And he still sits there?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Can we see?
I'm sorry.
Wow.  Thank you.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Not quite.
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
You re not thinking of going to...
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Too-do-loo, babe.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
I don't care.
We're here to say, your government was right.
You want an address on that last one?
What job?
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Employer?  The president?
Tell me about it...
Sharp.
With a little jazz.
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
...Why don't I just type this up...
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
I know that, Amy.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
I don't know...
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Tell me about it.
I'm sure you do.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Well, I --
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy, you were --
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Say, that was a swell idea!
Yes sir...
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I haven't had --
Wait a minute!
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Damnit, where's my car!
Maybe he's wise.
...Her mother needs an operation...
He don't look wise.
She is!
She's damn good, Lou.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Where?
That's nonsense, Alma.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
You don't believe in it?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Thank you.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Mr. Holland?
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
It'll wait.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Wait. I want to listen.
Of course, Wes.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
You can't really believe that.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I am not a frightened girl.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Why did you come in here?
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
Yes.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Got a meeting uptown.
Good night.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
What's on your mind? Don't --
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Ben.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Fine.
Yeah.
Sure dad.
What?
Good night kiddo.
Nothing.
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
Yeah.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
A key party?
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
It's really quite all right.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Social work?
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
But not too ashamed.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Moisture! Moisture!
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
What is it?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Who said so?
Out.
Sure.  Twinkie?
I dunno. I --
I don't know.
Wendy!
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Charles, what time is it?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Hey Sandy.
The ones you built?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
What's that, then?
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
We already did.
Then change it.
I don't remember.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Worth pursuing?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
To do nothing.
What are we thinking?
Don't do this, Hap...
That's not what he thinks.
Huh?
Huh?
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Best friend?
Long as it's fun.
You don't know.
What was?
Who?
What was it?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Did you have sex with her?
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
No back-up.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Your lover.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
You said there were none.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Yes... My God...
I can't save her.
Louis, I swear I did not.
Stop her Louis!
He jests.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
Yes...
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
And no one knows but us...
Yes, and very beautiful.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love?
Yes...
Give it to me!!!
I want it!
How do you mean, start?
Dying?
I want a woman.
Do you think so?
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
NO!!!
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
No...
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Lestat, what do you mean?
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
I tried...
Yes.
How could I not? She had to know.
Yes...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
My daughter...
Is that bad?
What about a radio?
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Karla! You promised.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
You're okay. Thank god.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
He's in it with Willis?
Rio, baby!
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Why?
Hello?
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
How much?
How much?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
No. I shot him.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
Must have missed the sign.
How's the water?
You don't have to be a jerk.
And do what with it?
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
She's in her room.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I don't know now without my father.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
They shall not hurt you
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
What an odd question!
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
You wouldn't tell that ——
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
Yes?
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Her name is Thea?
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt —— after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
Thea?
I can't understand that.
We have no time for that.
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
Listen to what I say --
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I can't.
It is for that he hates me.
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, very funny.
Well, who are you, then?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Our clothes are dry.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
Sit down? What are . . .
Yes, but George . . .
The Building and what?
They went out of business years ago.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Of course it's the place.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Uh-huh.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
I'm all right.
Came back three days ago.
Nice girl, Mary.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Uh-huh.
No.
Yes –– charge.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Oh, George.
Aw, forget it.
Hope you enjoy it.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's pretty young for that job.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Hello, Violet.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
It's important.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
They're not my children.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Neither am I.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
That does it –– come here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
What plates?
With butter, if they got any....
So's mine.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
I hope that's the cousin.
We better go back in.
That's awful.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Want to swim home?
Anyone got another set of sails?
No!  It's still there!
It's still there!
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Please.  It's my job.
Got it.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
What else you got?
Me neither.
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Is that what it is?
What's that supposed to mean?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Late.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Why?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Home it is.
It's good with coffee.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Nothing, huh?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I know, I know....
Shouldn't he be at home?
Hiya yourself.
Help!  Help!
Next week.
Just like this.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
Mike?  Our Mike?
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Figure they split?
Until we find something.
What the hell is it?
No.
I can go out if I want to.
I love it.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Might as well.
When are we going out?  You and me?
You going with Patrick?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Coming about, then.
You always go with Andy.
Would you take him?
Len, can I see you a minute?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
He thought he had a good reason.
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
I can get it.
With those camera lights and...
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Don't forget you have your brother.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
They just wanted to say hello.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Yes.
No.
... Me, too.
You don't.
... Mean through the tubes?
... He ought to put him in here.
Well, that's why you got it.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
I'm  fine.
Yes, aren't we all.
No, no.  That won't do.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
No!
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
So do I, love.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
She, Mister Hutton.
Sure.  No problem.
Someone's looking for you.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
I don't know, what else is there?
He's diving!
Hold still, damn it!
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
What?
Aww, can't I keep it?
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
What the hell's there?
Oh...
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
It's large enough...
Five hundred yards.
Right, Mike.
So was Dad.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Who's grown up?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Watch me, Grandma....
But you always let me....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
It sure is....
We need beer....
I'm not on vacation....
Spent it all on beer....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Stop what?
Adds flavor....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
What's going on?
Thank you....
I'll miss you....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
Okay.
I am.
You just got here....
I don't want to talk about that.
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I always listen to my feelings....
Doesn't matter....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
A big one....
You're always taking time off....
What?
Won't you get in trouble...?
Why?
Yes I can....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
You got a better idea...?
You sure you know how to do this.
The females have eggs....
They put bombs on dolphins....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Holy shit!
When I signed on....
We got it together, Jake....
So did I....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Screw you, Jake....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
When he has a pillow over his head....
What?
Yeah?
I hope I'm not intruding?
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Because, don't get into it ...
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
Car accident.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
I guess by the bed.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
You ain't going in alone?
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
No, Sir.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
What are you looking for?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
I don't know.
It was probably the wind.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
He said that? What else did he say?
I'm going back to the institute.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I don't want them to arrest you.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
Yes, Sir.
The man from the F.B.I.
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Ugh!
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Jerry!  Do something --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
-- stop --
No.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Bill, Rod, wait --
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
My son... my mind...
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Same to you.
We are?
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
We will be fine!
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
What?
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Very much.
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
Forget it.  Forget it.
How do I know?
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
No, you're --
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Go.  Flee.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Not a chance.
You okay?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Hi Ray.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
What is it?
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
People change.
Nothing.
You couldn't have made that jump.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
I would completely support that.
How low?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
What about Eric?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
He loves you too.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
They're here.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
I don't think so.
Baryonyx?
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
I try not to.
The last of my breed.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
I want to be an astronaut.
No. I couldn't see.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Minimal.
It doesn't matter what I think.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
Not without a shot of the nest.
My vacation is over in a week.
Which one?
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Where does it say that?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
The velociraptors.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Piss.
She's nuts.
Oh, my God.
Our chance to do what?
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
It has a broken leg!
Where's Kelly?
Look!  Sarah!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Why did you come here?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Are you insane?!
Birdshit?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
JUMP!
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Damn!
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Uh - - about two million.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
John....
Why?
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
They smell.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
The - - agility.  You're right!
Say again?
Dilophosaurus.
- - barfs them up - -
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
The other car!
I don't know.
What's that?
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Yeah.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
- - shut up.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Thank you.
I doubt it.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Nope.
Try to!
Why?
The kids okay?
I didn't say I was scared.
You're sure?!
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Dorkatops!
You're a beautiful big animal.
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Sure.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
They don't bother me.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Yeah?
You have a map.
I really think we should go back...
He... he's here...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
What?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
None of that's true?
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Yeah, what is it?
So what do we do?
Not yet.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
And if he's not?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
-- In what sense?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
Success or nothing?
In a manner of speaking.
What an extraordinary request!
Then its authority is in doubt.
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Sit down, Kafka.
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I know.
No.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
I -- I found your jailer.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
I don't know.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
What did she say?
You mean you've actually begun some?
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
I photographed it extensively, father.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Value? ... Value?
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
We're leaving.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Didn't want you.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
My name's John Klute.
Mm.
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
What do you think?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
You said you wanted these.
I don't see anything, do you?
Not much point to this, is there?
Thanks.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Yeah.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
How do you know how bad it was?
Trask wants to talk with you.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
OK.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
It's not so bad.
What's in it?
It's in the report.
Did she talk about him to you?
I think she's trying that.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Trask --
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
He's in his room, playing.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
What about your mommy?
Uh huh...
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
No.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Good night.
Dad?
You like it?
Yep.
No, she never did.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Why does he decide?
Where will my toys be?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes...
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
No.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
What?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
Yes...How's Billy?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Beautiful.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Sure.
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
I know....I know.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
No.
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
Look, Ted, all I--
Ted, don't be so hostile.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
No.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
A moment.
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
No cried?
Can I do anything I want?
But, I am in charge.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
Are you, General?
And we will begin with tearing it down.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Time to study.
Then, we shall meet.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
I miss my brother.
Britain?
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
I will not go.
Thank you.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
You will always!
You decide.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
Pretend.
You cannot.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
I would not know. Maybe.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
We have.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
We cannot.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
How could I ever leave?
What would you do, Holiness?
It is a difficult situation.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
I need to see his habitat.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Mr. Cyr!
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Cocktail?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
A spring trap!
They don't really attack underwater and--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
We both know what they'll do.
Right.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
That hurt my feelings.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Oh, bullshit.
No.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I'm sorry but you're...
Good.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Good.  See ya soon.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Look.
Alright, Jack!
Good idea.
You wouldn't?
He heeds a tourniquet.
Good thinking.
Let's go.
Obviously I was wrong!
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
What kind of backup do we have?
I got nothing against--
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
You like Jack?
Hector thinks you like him.
She's worried about the cow now.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
A jerk.
A tooth?
Part of our research--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
I will... I promise.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
I think we may be, yes.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Murdered...? How?
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Did you ever work with her?
Sometimes you do.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
All flayed...?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Mmm. And what else...?
Was it a butterfly?
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Killed outright?
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Why so briefly?
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Yes...
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Yes. I'll tell you.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Did you breast-feed her?
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Can we rest soon?
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Miss.  May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
I have nothing to go back for.
When? How?
There was no letter.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
You're not coming with us?
What else?
What did you see, Major?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
Sir!
Gifts?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Granted.
France.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
What?...
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
No.
I got hung up!  Try this!
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Good...It's going good.
Can't we fix it?
Where's Jones?
I can't see them!
...I'd really have to show it to you.
What's your air reading?
Okay.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Beautiful.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Russian.
It...almost got you.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
He's tanking on us...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
Under there?
What are you going to do to him?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Let's hope it holds.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Oh man, that's just great...
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Well, talk.
It's hit us all hard!
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Apart from those shotguns.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Yes?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
No Harry, you can't.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Try that one.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
Furry muff, let's go.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
No.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
What the fuck is going on?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
. . . What?
I'11 meet you in the car.
You will what?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Well, perhaps you can help?
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
At what, exactly?
Nick the Greek.
How the fuck should I know?
They're not going to jail.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
Yes, sir--
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Yes, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
So is Buddy on your short list?
You little pissant--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Do I seem jumpy?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
But they were Indians themselves.
You know who I am?
That guy who got shot--
Dad--
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
My father.
Cool.
You lived in the States for a while?
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
If the next guy's a redneck.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
Why would you want to do that?
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Bandidos, Injuns--
Aqui! [Here!]
We was crossin' the river--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Seems like we have another one every week.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
--Santiago.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Right.
You go by your old house?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
And the ten thousand?
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
A little older than Paloma is now.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
I don't mean Fernando.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
He's going to wish he was dead.
He ever accept cash for a favor?
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Yeah.
What was your father's name?
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
I appreciate you telling me.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You sell much out here?
So when did Buddy leave?
No--
You know who it was?
He's gonna find out.
Nix?
Nope.
A Nix specialty?
Knew what?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
All right.  It was...
I could scoop them out.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
Yes...
He's with us... He's with us...
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Sure.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Why?  Because he had you?
Quaid and Jennifer--
Harry...
I... have... to.
Harry-?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
--vanished.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
Oh, I've got plenty.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
You know of him?
Are you a gambling man?
Swann's wife.
What about?
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
Will that do?  No?
Is that all?
No.
Looks that way.
In my time, and nobody else's.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Yes?
I don't know.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I got to go.  I'm late.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
A couple of weeks.
What?
What about Philip Swann?
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
Is he the Puritan?
And he's dead?
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Philosophy.
I know, it's stupid.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Where'd you grow up?
Because that would be too easy.
How old is she?
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Yeah, look at that thing.
Tomorrow.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Yes?
Yes?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Good-night.
Is there anything I can do?
Alright?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Tomorrow.
One moment, please.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Good...I'm tired.
What?
I got some hair stuff.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Do you think they have a room here?
It's probably trivial.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
It's nothing.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
I think I should join you.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Something he said, just before...
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Father, I'm right here.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Kelson, hold on a second...
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
What's the bible for?
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
You are the younger of two...
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Get out of here.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
He's looking right at me.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
That's ridiculous.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Are you okay?
You're a caterer?
Really?  Well, come on, then.
This time get your feet set.
You're cold?
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
No one's forcing her.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
How'd you get him to say yes?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
Chances are there's still a chance.
She hates all freshmen.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Didn't have to try very hard.
Just one word of advice for next season.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
He works at a bank.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
I don't care.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
For how long?
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
You either.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Yeah.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
Here I am.
Hey, what's up.
The "man" again.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Uh huh.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Something was just missing.
Better late than never, right?
Well, can you give him this for me?
We still have to go?
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
You came out early.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
I don't know.
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
What's wrong?
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Brain and Lung.
Oh that's good.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
What's that stand for?
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
I'm sorry.
Well...is that illegal?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
Let's make a deal.
Can I tell you something?
What?
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
You mind if I come in, check things?
Claudia.
Diet Coke.
It doesn't matter.
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
Son, don't --
Put the gun down, please, boy.
Son, please, now....
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Finish it up without the lip.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
What?
Stay that way.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Braces.
Don't do this, Don.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
I'm trying.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
-- memory?
I've seen it before.
Go fuck myself?
Twelve.
Is this 509-9027?
You got us a room so quick?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Is that still lingering?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Not really.
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
What am I doing?
I'm quietly judging you.
people die.
What name?  My name?
I'm really sorry.
Oh yeah.
Uh. huh.
yeah.
What's this, how did this happen?
No.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
Did your wife find out?
Then what?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
I won't.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
I'm drinking.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
I'm not through asking my questions.
Maybe...I don't...
Did you ever touch her?
I don't know what I've done.
No they don't --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Hang up the phone.
....it's alright....
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Yes. What? Yes.
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Love you too.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Sure.
I don't know.
Hi.
This happens....this is something that happens.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
And you were not hurt?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
D'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I wish to discuss your brother.
Shut up, knave!
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
No, not Louis!
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
What use am I?
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
Who?
Who does?
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
Perhaps this will help.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
To kill the king.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
She will be at the ball.
D'Artagnan...
Who came?
And you never knew why?
At least help Raoul.
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
... Two-thirty-seven.
What was the end page?
Yes, yes, go on.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
A letter.  May I see?
You would do that, your Majesty?
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Yeah?
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
What do you need?
Did you report it stolen?
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
And he took a swing at you?
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
He said he was following up some lead.
Yeah?
You're the mysterious type, right?
No...
You'll find out - soon enough.
Yeah.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
Please...
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Not with this...
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
That's when it happened?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
How are Molly and the boy?
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Not the Bible?
Library of Congress.
Read it.
I have to.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
As long as they're dead...
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Why?
See? You do know something about him.
To recover the mind set.
The mark? Yes.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
No.
When I'm done.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
How far away's the back-up?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
He went to the men's room.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Tonic will be fine.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
Are you okay...?
You'll come by?
It's me.
No.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
I don't want to know.
I'm very scared.
Yes.
Yes.
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Yeah. It's right here.
No.
Uh... sure...
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Hi, Linda. ..
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Thank you very much.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Blue, then.
I love you...
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
I remember.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
I have to go back to Birmingham.
I want to see you, too.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
You going back down to Florida after?
Go on to the house.
Go on to the house...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You had disadvantages.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Yes. I'd considered it.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I haven't decided yet.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Hi George!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
But wasn't it funny?
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But it's only for thirty seconds!
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Why??  I... I attend every year.
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Oh.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
What's your name?
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
Two grand.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
You killed them.
The Matrix isn't real!
What are you doing?
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
... Yeah.
What happened to them?
I got you.
Are they any agent?
Goddamnit!
Go.
He's beginning to believe.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
What do you know?
You could say that.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
No.
The Matrix?
You've never used them before.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
But what?
What do you mean, without him?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Why?
What?
She told me...
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
I'm going in after him.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
I believe I can bring him back.
I'm coming with you.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
They're hacking his mind.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
You're not far from Cypher.
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
I'll be all right.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
I don't know.  I lost him.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
Anybody wanna have a game?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Yeah.
No.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Ok, how's everything going?
No.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Ok...that's it.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Fine.
No you weren't.
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
What do they expect you to say?
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Here.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
A paper on that one too?
You're intolerable today.
The girls like it loud.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Yeah, so things'll be even.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Quiet please.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
He's coming.
Love that name.
Hi, Allison --
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
No.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
It's for the party, Dad --
Yes, it is.
But what?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Right away.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Am I not obligated to?
Hello, Quince.
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
Did you just hear something?
No no, not you.
Do you think I need a haircut?
'Just kidding'?
How nice for you both.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
No, no.  I on holiday.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Sure.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
How did you meet?
What do you mean 'free'?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I don't have any.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Not now.
I don't know.
Yes.  I'm tired.
-- I guess you haven't.
It was everything.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
I don't know who you are.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
Yes!
And you can't tell me who you are.
'Love will find out the way'.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Thank you.
'Threw' you?  Where?
No.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
I guess so.
Of course.
It's all yours.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
Goodnight.
Just a manner of speaking.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
Yes?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Thank you.
I guess you have your reasons.
'...Yes --'
Of course.
I don't!
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
Yes, Bill.  The question.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
You like him, don't you?
So what's wrong with that?
You're not listening --
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Yer damn right.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Will it?...
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Then what will you say?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
I agree --
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Then why is this my handwriting?
When was I in here?
Hi, Leonard.
Yeah?
A cop?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't remember.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Did you?
There are things you know for sure.
What happened?
Who did he go to meet?
And what did he say?
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Somebody's come. Already.
Help me.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
How do you know about me?
Who's your boyfriend?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Then why are you here?
You're in a playful mood.
You know it?
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
What's wrong with this one?
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Why are you following me?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
It makes all the difference.					 *
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
No. You took them out.						  *
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
Lemon or lime?
I was the kids' godfather.
"And" what?
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Okay.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
No.
Died in childbirth, having me...
Twenty-eight-point-five.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Why?
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Of course.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
I'll be on board by noon.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
No.
Nothing.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's the point?  It's going down.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
What would you do...?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Alonzo...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Sure you're all right?
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
I mean, dammit, where you live?
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
They gotta be.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
What?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Yessir, I can see that.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
What?
You want to split your hernia again?
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
I know.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Would you recognize him again?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
...She was on the plane.
Lucky girl.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
That doesn't seem so bad.
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
Where is it?
Yeah.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Maybe he's changing jobs.
What is it? . . . Billy?
That's a great philosophy.
Work, work, work, that's all do
Mr. Yesil.
Who got the Frenchman out?
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Depends.  You got a memo?
Go!! Just go!!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
Manny...
I'll be late.
I was just late.
Susan, we're not b-
No.
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
How?!
Peter-
The scent won't last...
Try not to sweat?
We can do it!
No shit.
Sure.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
I don't have a title yet.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
It's fine.
The phones are working?
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Misery?
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
I know how that can be.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Yes.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
No, just the paper will be fine.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
--cliff-hangers--
The what?
What?
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
No, I haven't.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Three more chapters to go.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
I'm almost done.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
You're still a writer.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
That'd be a first.
Great.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
Hugh, I'm impressed..
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
I suppose I did.
To do what?
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
I'm not ready!
Right.
I hope there's a place to land.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
What if I pay the rent?
Oh, either way works for me.
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Ethan Hunt.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Five, six-hundred thousand.
I'd like a little more conviction..
I don't.
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Yes?
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
That simple, huh?
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
S.O.P..
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
All ten million.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
Krieger.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your God damn coat!
Who is they, who is they?
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
You didn't have to.........
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Go secure.
One hour.
Yeah.  I follow you.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Profitable.
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
I wouldn't dream of it.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
I remember..
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Itís not working.
I always check the batteries.
Very good.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Why you drinking so much?
I'm going to bed now.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
Bed.
Ti amo.
What's your news?
You did this once it didn't work out.
What killed him?
He did?
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
You have too many dogs.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Let me come and talk to you.
I know that. I do what I want.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
Don't just become excited.
You ruined my life.
I'm in love with you!
But he wants me to come!
Come on.
That's right.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
No?
Never is a long time.
I shouldn't.
A month from today?
Sure.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
We should talk alone.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Where's the ring?
And who's gonna pay for that?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Everything's different.
Oh.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Definitely!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
She was just too young for you.
What do you do?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
I think it's because they fear death.
Yes.
Sure.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
Oh. Right.
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
Yes!
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Please!
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Who are they?
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
Come on then.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Bedevere, my Liege.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
There.
It is the rabbit.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Course it's a good idea.
I'm getting better!
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your quest?
I can't take him.
I dunno, Must be a king.
He hasn't got shit all over him.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
What - the curtains?
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
We're coming with you.
Camelot ...
Oh ... hello ...
We'll cover your escape!
I don't think I was.
No, no, we must find the Grail.
No, I'm not.
Don't say that word.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Louder, girl!
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I see.
A situation?
Quite.
Whom you address.
It's so infernally cold in here.
It is quite late enough.
My own.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
Occasionally.
Quite.
I wouldn't know.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Aye.
They aren't as watchful as you.
The greasy pole.
No love.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Ma'am.
She's well, too.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
What?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
To keep out the cold.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Yes, ma'am.
Have I ever let you down before--?
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
The question is, do we need her?
Yes.
Of course.
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
Just them?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Why?
I have no idea.
He is sick, ma'am.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
What's the question mark?
How do you do that?
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
Laurie's.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
It's already out.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
I was afraid you'd say that.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
I can't believe you made it!
Everything.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
What?!  There's nothing here!
In this world, wrong is right!
Is that your question?
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
Sign me up.
Who fired everyone?
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Okay.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
Very pleased to meet you.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
Before what?
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
Okay.
Keep going. Go around to the back.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
Give me a fucking.....
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Let's go.
Yes.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
A dragon.
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
Not yet.
When will that be ?
Fire the whole division.
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
I am thirty two.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Sir ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
What happened ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Excuse me, gentlemen
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
Shut up ! It's me.
What ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Good morning.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
Don't mention it.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy.
What boy likes you?
Her favorite poet.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
I'll try.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Well...
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
I never met my mother.
You're so clever.
TAXI!!!
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What difference does it make?
Oh my gosh, here it is!
You would.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
And I thought I was weird.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Just give it to me!!
DON'T!!!
Owh...
Oh no?!?!?!
Leave me alone!!
What do you think?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Nick?
This has been a real confusing day.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Committed.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Sounds like you're very organized.
Phil for God sake.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Sort of?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
I know, look at his little hands.
O.K.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Yes they are.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Oh, how do you mean?
Okay, sure.
What happened to her?
In ages, I know, me neither.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight.
Okay.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Is it really your camper?
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Dad?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Why?
Can I go too?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Soon honey, soon.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Get away, get away!!
What??
No, no.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Thirty five dollars.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Do you think she is?
Why do you think she says that?
Can we look around in your camper?
Uh huh.
Mostly love, and romance.
Can I use your bathroom first?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Oh great!!
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Come on, it's fun.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Don't DO that!!
I stopped that!
Go???
Really?
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
He likes her better than me.
Leave then, some friend you are.
But, I don't know how.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Something like that.
I honestly wish I could...
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
We're about to find out.
No, he's ruining yours.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
You like her.
Impressive.
The man you love.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Well, we're...
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
He said that, too.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
No.
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Exactly.
Only.  If he wants to.
I just don't want to freak him out.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
... unless he has a hump.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Well, somet...
... Thomas, yeh.
Such as.
Hate that.
Endearingly absent-minded.
Quite the little eccentric.
She finds him "personable."
Firenze.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You keep saying that.
If you like.
Me either.
Well.
Yes.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Well, it happens.
... yeah, that.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
I came here, looking for her.
It's two weeks.
If you find her...
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
To him.
... and you knew about this.
MICHAEL!!
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
What do you have to buy?
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
What?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
You're so good.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Bye, Bye.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
What does he want?
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Minimum.
D.C.
Okay.
Where the hell have you been?
Your brother?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Can I help you?
I think we can do that. Come in.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Nash.
Next you'll be sick.
Bet the sheets are grey.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
When I was little, in church.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Wow!
I've got a gig tonight.
I have to go.
Older.
You sound different. Is that really you?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
For him?
Oh?
Where are you from?
You always live there?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Who?
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Sure thing.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
More or less...
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Thank you, sir.
Susanville, Soledade.
I can appreciate that.
Ain't love grand.
How's it goin'?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
What?
Yes, sir.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
I'm keen with anticipation.
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Says who?
No.
On average forty million.
Got it.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
NO!!!
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Next week's episode.
I hear ya. Play.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Rockin'!
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Why?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Is that her real name?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
And me.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
All right, you get out of here, man!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
No. You got the wrong idea.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Thanks.
Guess I don't.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah? That's good.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
What d'you expect?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Oh yeah, and then what?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Why did you?
'Been up north?
What d'you mean?
Just for the day?
Four.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Well, what d'you think?
Huh?
Yeah.
You will.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
What 'you signifyin'?
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
'Got a good thing, man.
Yeah, see you in hell.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Great.
No, they won't.
I doubt it.
It ain't in me.
It's for your own good.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
Hi.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
I ain't drunk, honey.
Since when?
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
Of course...
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
Dixie McCoy
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Can you read my mind?
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
All things possible in Babylon.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Right...
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
We got problems topside.
Less than thirty minutes.
Case.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
And Linda...
Why should I want to meet him.
What's that supposed to mean?
What the fuck... are you serious?
A regular Fagan.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
I'll be okay.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
What went down between you and Riviera?
...And if I guess wrong?
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Nice.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Exactly.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Why?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Have you been to any parties?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
Hey. There.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
See!
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
No. Josie, this is real.
Rufus?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Thank you.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
I don't have to say that.
Why do you do that?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I just can't look at you the same way.
I finally found my story.
Nah uh.
We're very evolved.
Lock.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
Barrel.
And heavy...
Where?
For this.
I know.
I can't help it.
No.
He stayed a long time.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
Specifically.
Maybe he doesn't know...
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Who?
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What's this?
What do you mean?
C'mon, cut it out.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
About what?
I'll get over it.
Ghostbusters are fearless.
Oh, Jesse...
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
I'm not hungry.
There's nothing to figure out.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I killed him!  I killed him!
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
All of them.
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
First door up the stairs.
He's full of shit.
That's right.  I don't.
Mom?
I had such an awful dream.
I gotta stay up, Max.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
Do you still...see each other?
I -- I think so!
How do we find him, Kristen?
I don't know.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Thanks, Max.
Thank you.
Nancy...
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
So do I.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Your dreams?
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
How do we get in?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Uh, fourteen.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Where...here?
Well, they can be.
No.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Oh -- Okay.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
You abide by rules like that?
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
You've got to go.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Well done you.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
My son's name is Johnny?
Well, get a message through to him too.
What do you think?
Okay.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
You do?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Okay.
What's the thing?
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Nice surprise.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
And this is William.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Yes, I think that one may be.
What?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Shame!
What's your name?
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Any bit in particular?
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Definitely no comment.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
She's perfect, perfect.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
May I help you, sir?
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
No -- you're right.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Yes.
Fabulous.
No, Miss Ratched...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
No! No! No!
What for?
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
A vote is before the group.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
No.
Yeah, Mack?
Where ya goin', Mac?
Right, Mack!
Yeah!
Shhh...
Me, too...
My feet hurt...
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
Now, what would I be trying to say?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Sure, Mack...
No!
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Yeah, it's cold!
No.
What is it?
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Oh, what was that?
In what way?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
I'm afraid not.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
'Kay, Mac!
You're on!
What's going on?
How much ya wanna bet?
Sure...
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
You's better believe it, brother!
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Okay. How you doing?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Big man!
On what?
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Oh...
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Why, sure, ma'am...
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Oh, yeah...
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
--separate, in the evening..."
Your hair... is perfect.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
Let's find a telephone.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Exactly.
Your great aunt.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Wait.  I have to write this down.
No.
But Faith--
Non.  Please.
Hm.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
You aren't?
Well.  Congratulations.
GET OUT!!
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
And more...
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Is he gay?
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I know...  It was.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
I think he's having an affair.
But it's July.
Because you were afraid to fly.
He fell out.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Sure you did.
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
What?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
What if he doesn't like me?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
When you could've found one in America.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
You miss me?...
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She didn't give me a chance.
She's not here.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
I'm not thirsty.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
It's a living.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
I know. I know.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Why Edie, I—
Terry... Terry... .
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Man, you were a mess!
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
I only live up there and across the roof.
Good. So do I.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
That was nice of you.
In a saloon?
How about another one?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
What for?
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
You?
I just told the Father.
Edie— it's—
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Get away from me.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Who is he, Pop?
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Mind your own business, Father.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
I'm just resting my feet.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Hit me again.
So-so, Johnny.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
How'd you get that.
You want to know somethin'—?
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
I was only talkin' to her.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Keep Charley out of this.
One of these days.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
It would seem so, Master.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
I know a Glenn.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Who are you?
Why don't we talk about it later?
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Her phone's probably tapped.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Forty-five minutes.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Yes, she did.
I get that feeling, yeah.
And who watches your back?
Jack --
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
It was an unusual experience.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Is that what you would've done?
You'll have to ask him.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
They're in 7D.
You're gonna use a ram?
Wait.  You not Adele?
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
I don't smoke.
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
I thought everything.
I wasn't asking permission.
Not until recently.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Bleeding on a country road.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
Love it.
It would be worth the risk.
He killed a police officer.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
I don't know...
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Must be a real soft pillow.
Any time.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
Five point two.
For a time.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Glenn?
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
I'm freezing my ass off.
Uh-huh.
Gimme another hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Thanks.
You a lawyer?
Something better.  Open it.
It's a --
Oh, he's moved out?
Then they're not separated, are they?
You used to like it.
I see that.
It's possible.  Why?
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Ten gees.
Are they dead?
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
You guys are new?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Good shooting, Rafe!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Fuck you.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Home of the Brave.
I can't make it.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
Brilliant, Admiral.
God help them.
All of 'em.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
Peggy Sue!
I'm not telling.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Stag movies. Smokers.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
Aren't we a little old for that?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Pretty strange.
Oh yeah?
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Good.
Great, isn't it?
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Is this slow enough for you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Who?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Let's go down to the basement.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
What?
Of course.
Test?
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
What are you shooting for?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I hate chickens.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
What a treat.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
At my age? Don't be silly.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
How do you feel?
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
What do you mean?
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Rosalie Testa!
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
I don't know.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Am I dead or not?
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
When do we start?
What are you talking about?
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Did you break up with Charlie?
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Pretty much so.
How'd you know that?
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
It's been a few years.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
I'm not hungry.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
What did?
You never get over it.
What do you mean?
Go later...
All the time.
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Andy?
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
You're going to the office?!
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
More than your friend. Family.
Honesty is always best.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
Little baby girl.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Continue.
Continue.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Fine.
They didn't fire her?
We're friends of Beckett's.
Not bad.
Sure. It's fine.
Correct.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
Really?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Why are we going to do that?
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Who?
Yeah... ?
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
You had one guy "like that?"
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Andy, you don't want this.
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Entered our minds.
<u>Listen</u>.
Like the light is scalding it.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Like what?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
How many?
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
79 kilos.
We're just burnin' light here.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
There is no "safe."
Which half?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
About the girl.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Just the same, I want one.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Good luck then.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
No, they won't -
Zira....
That way.
Him.
Sustained.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Huh?
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Try telling them our names.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
What is it?
I think you're making a mistake.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Yeah, what is it?
Fuck you bitch.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Youse so fucked up man.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
What?
Then what do you suggest big shot?
No!
Dawn...
I volunteered.
What are the heads?
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I haven't been invited.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
How do you do?
Why certainly, baby.
How careful should I be?
Immigration Officer?
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
I see.
Whatever you say.
Do you think I don't?
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Much too late.
I don't.
There wasn't any plane.
Bad enough.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
They know you here--know your name.
Couldn't be.
All right--following me.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
And Betty Mayfield--
This must have cost a fortune.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
Do you think I was faking?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Ale. I don't mind.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
I've never been to Florida.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
To do what?
Sometimes.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Morning. Any calls?
Got the information on you?
Martini.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
How's life treating you?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
I don't.
I wouldn't know.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Did I do something wrong?
How would you know, Brandon?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
That's not enough.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Let me know when you've identified him
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Would you?
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Open it and count it.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Well.  What about it?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
I'm interested in who handled it.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
I'll take your word.
How do you do, sir.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
Years, why?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Yes.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Well, we were just...
Yes.
What went wrong?
Sit on that log, dear.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Very good.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Exactly that.
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
And to history.
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
How nice.
Very thoughtful.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
The Argies.
Let me see.
Oh yes.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
That's good.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
No.
U-huh.
Oh no!
Promise?
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
A flaw I'm working on.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
My man!
You do it... you first!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
I say when it's over!
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
I'm not FBI anymore.
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
There's nobody else here...
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Babes.
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
What that?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Got it...
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Thanks, buddy.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Nothing.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
You know you can't win this one.
It's been a long time, General.
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
I think it's Hawkins.
Twenty-five percent.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Please, we hardly know each other.
You've got a lot of nerve.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Yes.
Sit... and spin.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Fine.
Diet coke.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Just a romantic, that's you.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
I have work to do.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Good.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Please.
He died a long time ago.
I think it's exciting.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Ready to stomp sod?
Vivian, what the --
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Vivian...
You just did.
What do you mean?
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Afternoon.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
I'm here.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
We're letting them slide?
Yes...
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Why?
Let him answer.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
I pray for that.
Do I!?  Momma!
Kit give me nothin'.
What?
Okay.
You're a guest here?
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Professionally?
Me?
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Yeah.  Thanks.
I swear it will be done.
You're a silly girl.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
Nothing you can say will upset me.
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Of course you will.
I will never doubt again.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
I thought I was going faster.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
What do I do?
He's really very short on charm.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
How many could you handle?
-- where?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
The body?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
What?
I don't be-leeve this.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
It won't be easy, Sire.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Who won? How did it end?
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
I thought he was with you.
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
He's already dead.
Hah?
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
Nothing comes to mind.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Then why are you smiling?
You know what a hurry we're in.
Morons.
Good. Then pour the wine.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
I'm not listening.
A good hour. Yeah.
Have fun storming the castle.
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
"Of the silvery moon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
It's nothing ... nothing.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
No kidding?
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Come on.  Let's get going.
Got dag pa dig.
Very nice girl.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Of Siegfried...
Nietzche...
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Vat?
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Where are you going vit the light?
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
Or arrived with her.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
Back where?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
How much?
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
All right.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
With the forty thousand dollars?
Lila.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Don't you know?
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
Yes.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Yes.
An hour! Or less!
Why can't I go out there with you?
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
You're not.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Sam. This is the last time.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I haven't even been married once yet!
Sam, let's go get married.
Don't miss your plane.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I have?
No.
Uncommon, too.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
Very early. Dawn.
Good night.
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Why?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Have you two had breakfast?
Yes.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
I didn't think so.
Leave me alone!
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
Yes!
But ... the dogs...
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I don't agree with you.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Well, I do say it.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Thank you.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
That is unfortunate.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Thanks.
You did miss --
I'm heading out of town.
I could go out of town.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
They were just bad men, that's all.
You were pretty bad, huh?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
He did?
Okay.
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
But how would you find him?
I think Daddy suspects.
What are they doing, Doll?
Buddy, that was my place.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Oh. Did you say something?
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Is she all right?
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
What did you forget?
Over... my... dead... body!
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Who?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Well, it has buttons.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Galley proof.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
She looks terrible, just awful.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Yes, Ma'am.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
It'll get better now.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
You're not gonna see him again.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
I need the "when" and the "where."
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
That wasn't my fault.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Clench your teeth.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
They shot us all, kid.
Same day as before.  I think.
Wha... ?
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
What was I supposed to do?
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
Nope.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Well, sir...
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Whatever goes bang.
Out here.  On your knees.
Dead.
Yeah.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I can't kill my own father.
Yoda spoke of another.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Luke!
All set.
I don't know.
Here's the terminal.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
I will not fight you, father.
On my mother's grave.
Janet.
I've got something to say.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Yes.
From Transexual Transylvania.
Like I'm outside in the rain
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
...I don't know.
Absolutely.
By accident?
...I suppose.
It doesn't bother me either.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
I sold them to you.
Yes, I do.
I should leave.
Don't tease me.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Paulie!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
What?!
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
...Stop jivin'!
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
No dollar.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
...Ten minutes.
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Bob.
That's it.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
...Fine.
You think I don't hear things?
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Gonna try.
Sparrin'?
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Hey --
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
I won't.
...Tomato?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, sure.
Freak luck is a strange thing.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
'Bout what?
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
What?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Looks, huh?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Let's get outta this stink.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
What?
Sure I like her.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
What can I do about it?
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
...People talk to me more.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Well, I'll be...
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
So where is it then?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
He's a Toon... who cares?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
So you're Cloverleaf?
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
No...
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Have you got the will?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don't.
Take it easy.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
A Toon?  Noooo.
Get away from there.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Forget it.
Yeah?
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Then I'll leave thee.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Good-morrow, cousin.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Art thou hurt?
Young Romeo is it?
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Welcome.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Amen
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Ay me!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Well what shall I swear by?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Right.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
What wouldst thou have with me?
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
And then...
That's why you were riding with him.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
I thought I did.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Duty calls?
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
I think not.  After you...
I take it you still want the money...
In here...
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Enough!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
I sent it to myself in Paris.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
Don't cross me...
How did you know?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
I didn't expect that he would.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Gets the job done.
Why don't you go do better, then...
Eat shit and die slowly...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Coordinate what?
To see a man about a thing.
That's what I thought.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
One's a lot more painful than the other.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
I just wanted to see something.
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I know of him.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Do what?
Dark ops?
Right now?
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Just like that?
I'll work on it...
What of it?
I might know where you could get a copy.
I get the picture.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Sure thing, and --
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Seven thousand...
Hell, it won't be us!
We'll figure something out.
What are you thinking?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
No.
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
There it is...now what about the others?
You killed him...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
He killed her...he killed her...
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
It's NOT too late!
Why don't you get to the point.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
What's that?
Nothing.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I don't believe it.
What did he buy?
Yeah.
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Dwayne.
Is this marked money, or what?
Well I just uh, you know...
Anything...specific?
No, I can't say that I have.
Sure.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
So be here at three.
Well I'm here now.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
What?
You're never getting that much.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
I was in the neighborhood.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
So someone did get away.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
How much is that?
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
This is your ship?
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
I knew you were lying.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Try to land on your feet.
I am a tourist.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
I'm calling for back up!
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
Who died?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
Why LA?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Mind your own business.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Dancing?
No problem.
This money is evidence.
I need your help.
Just trying to make it look real.
I'm fine.
Now you know.
I'll take him.
Don't.
Ricky Tan?
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Sir, I can explain.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Tell me about it.
So was I.
We are both full of shit.
I was being polite.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Stooly.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
Yee-aww.
It's him.
This concrete?  This is still America.
What?
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
No...what?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
It's Griffin.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
And what did you say?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
"Never say die."
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
You're coming here?
Then come for dinner.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
That must have made you proud.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Originality is my speciality.
You'll answer my questions?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
You can turn that finger around.
Really.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
Of what?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
I kissed him back.
A little longer for me.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Yup!
It's probably because you got him fired.
Where?
Why?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
I'm just finishing up, too.
Quick.  Very quick.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Yeah.
He's got a houseboat.
They're going to love you.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Happy New Year.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
You couldn't.
So what happened?
Actually, he sounded nice.
Not.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Becky?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
So I mailed your letter.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
Okay.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
What?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Any time.
Walter and I are engaged!
Hello.
It's me?
The cabinets have to be redone --
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
It's hard to imagine.
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
I don't know --
Seventy... eight.
What's tira misu?
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
It's a spice rack.
It's never happening again. Right?
Oh, you're changing your mind --
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
It doesn't.  They ask you.
I know.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
Was Mom an adjustment?
Who is Annie?
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
This is the one I like.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
Did not.
Get out.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
You must be Jonah.
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
What do you mean?
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
There's nothing stopping you.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Never... never... never!
I did forget. Luís told me.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
You mean Delaware?
I thought maybe you forgot...
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
The spiders.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
You like that?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Everything go?
I'll see you tonight.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Ouch.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Nothing.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You really need to lighten up.
This has nothing to do with him.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Therapy session is over.
Please open the door, Danny.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
I just can't. Okay?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I can't tell you.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Guess it's our turn.
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
10%.  That's ...
He doesn't have one.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Hey, I don't play that.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Okay! Okay!
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Tell me what?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Answer the fucking question!
What's he holding?
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Just admit you're wrong.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
That is so unfair.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
In West Fork?
No kidding.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
The Army gave you that?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Shut up, will you?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Gives Wade the second shot.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
Where are you from, Captain?
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
A machine gun.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Same place we are.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Goddamn it, sir...
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
I've got a line on one.
Nope.
Three for three.
Is it getting worse?
How about I go right, sir?
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
I know.
I'll do my best.
Yes, sir.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Yeah, how so?
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
You have orders, too.
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
We can't leave it here.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
I don't like that one.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
HERE THEY COME!
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Yes, sir.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What about you, Captain?
Who knows?  It worked.
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
And your former wife.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
For going to school?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
I am.
Come on, it's graduation.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
I can accept that.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Dad.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
I know that.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Yes, I...
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
I'm so ashamed dad.
You're right.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.  What a day.
No, I read it on the message.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Eight.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Job?  Being a great date.
Today is tomorrow.
Okay.
What did you say?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Yeah.
You're cold.
Then why are you shaking?
We decided...
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Just my dad.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Oh shit.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Fine Lloyd.
Yeah.  Honey?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Your car?
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Yeah.
I called her up.
I don't know.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
It's up to you.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
They're not gone, they're here.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
I pay you too much.
These people, my people, I want my people.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
Look it up.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
Something they can hold in their hands.
They should be.
Thank you.
They arrived, can you believe it?
There will be generations because of what you did.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
They've broken their pattern.
I won't.
Where is everybody?
Why aren't you there?
Why would you wanna do that?
No, it's me.
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
It’s over, Cotton.
Did you do it?
And much richer as a result.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Why don't you ask them?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Enter Cotton Weary.
What's your subject?
Yeah.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
It's under control.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
I find his work overwrought.
Until now.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
Not good.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Can we turn the light on?
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Let's find out.
Just in case...
That's not the way we play the game.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Watch your back.
Is Sid in therapy?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Yeah, right.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
I'd really just like to be alone.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
But...
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..harmonica style is okay.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Don't panic.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
To see your reaction.
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
To me Hollywood is about death.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
Sid I can see you!
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
They've got her!
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
And who is that?
What?
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Do you want us to come with you?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
They're the ones who approved it.
Who?
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
How do I know their voices are --
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
You know it.
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Yeah...
No, it's not.
She looked dead. Still does.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Now that it's out of your system.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Or even a good porno.
Are you serious?
I called my dad.
You don't still think it was me?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Do I?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
To talk.
You getting scared?
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
More of a game, really.
Or else what?
I'm getting scared.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
No...
Come on. It'll be fun.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I can't think.
YES!
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
No, not yet.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Deputy... good evening.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Mind if I join you?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Can I bring Kenny?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Not yet.
How is everything?
What were you doing out here?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
The phone's dead.
Just stay back.
Forget it.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Why would she lie about it?
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
What's your favorite scary movie?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
You got it.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
He came to make up.
Like you had one.
Wanna another beer?
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
No way.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
I don't know...
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
What am I? The beer wench?
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
So what?  This victim...
Greed.  It was written in blood.
What are you talking about?
I heard.
It would be too hard.
I'll see you.
Where was the girl?
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Why?
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Murderers like you?
Delusions of grandeur.
And, why is that?
It's close.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I realize that.
No one yet.
No.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
Tonight.
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Punishing.
Forced what?
Okay.  But, what?
No.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
Oh, it's alright.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
No.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
How is this legal?
I don't.  Neither do you.
We're focusing.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
That is.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Then, he must write about these murders.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Big surprise.
I will.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Wait!
I can't do this now... please.
What?
Oh... um, William.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
He mentioned it.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
I don't know.
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
JOINT action?
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
He just couldn't wait...
What?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Look?
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
It's what I'm countin' on.
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Ain't worth the mendin'...
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
It isn't fair...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
You'll never get away from me!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
It still worked in town.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
You?
Yes, daddy.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Someone from the village.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Hi, darling.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
Thank you.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
The title won't do.
Yes.
Really?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Twenty pounds on delivery
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
When I have fifty pounds.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
On my mother's side the Ardens
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
That's me.
Cut his nose off.
Of course not!
Oh, that.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Very well.
Yes, but very well.
Every word.
She is always Aphrodite.
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
What? Who?
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
What do we do now?
How goes it, Will?
The daughter of his enemy.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
Verona again.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
And I love poetry above all.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
"Madam!"
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Ay me."
But the plague
Oh. What is your name?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
It is strange to me, too.
There is.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
I must. I must
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
I was the more deceived.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
Orsino…good name
and thus unable to declare her love
How does it?
Nor you for me.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
You flatter, my lord.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I do not love you, my lord.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I am going to church.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
A man, my lord?
A theatre poet?
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Serve.
Will you shut up and play.
I haven't lost yet.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Can I show you something?
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
But not quite.
Can we talk about something?
Just stop worrying.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
I don't know.
Looking for you? Yes.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Well, then?
What?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Yes.
What?
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
What I am.
-- which is a hack.
Open it.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
No, I don't.
Are you all right?
No, no, it's different.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
He can't stay up there.
Oh, good.
Forget it.
And the money?
Everything.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
We were just sorting things out.
You were going to say something.
You mean I can have the room?
Of course.
No, three. Who said there were four?
Yes, absolutely.
Do you smoke?
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds?
I should hope so.
It was on the television.
You and me?
And you need your sleep.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Sorry?
Right here?
Eh --
I'm not sure --
Yes, sir.
What happened to that guy?
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
A priest who dies.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
Did he sound upset?
It's an improvement.
No. But he needs treatment.
What?
Who?
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
Gee, that's very serious...
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
Whatever you say.
Why don't you see Lester?
I don't know. Just a minute...
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Right now, I just don't care.
Uh-uh.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
It isn't?
Okay.
No thanks.
Yeah.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Don't make conversation with me.
I am not!
Well, yeah... you know.
I guess not...
I've got heads here, Norman.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Probably the bathroom.
Why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
I just have to do one little thing.
Did I what?
No you didn't.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Not me, pal.
-- do you want ice?
-- we are?
-- well you better go after her.
-- you've got to leave.
Lester's on his way.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- how did you get here?
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
What about me?
I am?
Do you really mean that?
What!
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Great.
How did it go at the bank?
Could I talk to you for a second?
Could I?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
-- go ahead.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I didn't want him meeting me here.
I just want to know, that's all.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
What did you say?
What did you say?
No?
Well, yeah.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
Sure.
-- yeah?
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
But...
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Yes I do.
What?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
No.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
A soap?
George is going to open a shop.
Who do you think I was talking to?
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Don't be silly.
Well, it's George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
Didn't you have any panties on?
What did you do?
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
-- oh I don't know --
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
No.
Have they sat down?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Do you like this hotel?
What do you mean?
Yes, Dad.
Yeah.
I'm not supposed to.
Tony.
Do they know he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Danny, come on over here.
Danny, come here!
Oh!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Yes, sir.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
What line of work are you in now?
Your money's no good here.
Yeah.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
Yes.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Yes.
Of course you are.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Wendy...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Not for me.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Oh!
Fine.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Blue. This blue.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
Will you?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
What kind of noises?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
No.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
You want to know what I think?
I told you!
There! You see!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Were you tempted?
SING!
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
You can handle this.
What did who say?
Yes?
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
What is it, Betty?
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Chops?
Because we're
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
What a shame!
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
You know that song?
Mary Robert.
Wet behind the ears.
What?
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
You know?  About me?  About everything?
You re okay -- for a civilian.
I... I...
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
She won't?  Why not?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Mary Clarence!
Experience!
Bless you.
It's true!
Your name?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You mean black people?
No problem.
I'm outta here.
And whom would you call?
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
No.  No.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
The majority has spoken.
You have a phone call.
I must go where I can be of use.
Saving you.  Move!
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
What?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
I think they'd understand.
Oh-huh.
We didn't tell you what?
Not... totally.
It didn't work, Vince.
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We're losing it.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She wasn't a nun?
But how do we get there?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
Find 'em!
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
To place it inside its coffin.
A diseased monster.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Pardon me?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Well... that might be... helpful.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I did not ask you to, did I?
Up.
I have others.  All I need is this.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
We should go.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
Lady Van Tassel...
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Small talk.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
There is no such thing as magic.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
I insist that you have it.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
What?
The skull is gone.
It was you there?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
He moves too fast.
His horse.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
What did you say?
Yes.  Here...
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman.  Yes.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
I can't remember.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
That boy wants me to.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Good to know you, Karl.
You have any biscuits for sale?
What you got that's good to eat?
French-fried potaters.
What you got in there, warshing?
It's too big.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
What?
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Don't tell me what to do.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
It went real good.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
Childers.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
Yeah.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Two people.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Naw.
Yeah.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A little ol' boy.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
No sir.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
I ain't got no boy.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Yes sir.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn't aim to.
No ma'am.
Right now?
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
What's that you say?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Not really to speak of.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Do you smell shit?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
No thank you.
Signs?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
The Queen of England?
Yeah, I did.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
Fuck you, kid.
Not a peep.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
I mean, it's a good story.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What is this, some kind of joke?
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
And why the hell would you give me money?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
What does that mean?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
And his parents?
And?
Those are pretty hostile words.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Jesus.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Say hi to Paul.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Well what?
What do you want me to say?
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I owe you something.
I mean breakfast.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Take good care of yourself, okay?
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Come on, just a little hint.
The end.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
It's all right. I really do know them.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Oh, yeh?
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Why not?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Tht was summation, Your H...
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Won't take two.
You're right.  I better use two.
You're wondering why I held it.
Still lashed to the mast.
Maybe...?
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
I'll take two.  One for later.
I was checking the cables.
I think you like learning.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
That's all he said.
Bye.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
It's entirely mutual.
Yeah.  Why?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
With you.
We're not too late, are we?
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I got pinched in the elevator.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
That's right.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
I am.
You think he's too old for me?
Like right after the ceremony.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
We're not on the pier yet -
Terribly sorry.
I'll say.
Isn't that ridiculous?
You got some?
I'm fine.
Half-full.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
I'm just going to get some ice.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Come on, Daphne.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Oh yes, we do!
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
What's the big idea?
- you got to be blonde -
Help yourself.
Goodbye?
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
We won't breathe a word.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
My car?  Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
It's not the backs that worry me.
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Oh.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
You're entitled.
Would you mind terribly?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Well, I'm not.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
For your own amusement?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
- Inauguration balls -
- riding to hounds -
I beg your pardon?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
What?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
I am?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
You mean you can't fall in love?
What happened?
Talk about sad.
Thanks just the same.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
From a rich millionaire.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
I never join nothin'.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
Yes, sir.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Why wouldn't I?
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
Hey.
What for?
Still--
I’m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
She did?
Um, just about everyone.
I’m a hooker.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
No, tell me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
You’re funny.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
A weekend?
Shampoo, got it!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Desperation?
Yeah.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
You have more than one gynecologist?
I haven’t thought about that in years.
Is there any other way to take it?
That's right--
Sure--
You could? How?
Yes mam...
But where is my daddy!?
What do that mean?
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
What's that, son?
Yes mam...
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Did you find your father?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Yes, ma'm...
Come in, children.
I'll walk...
I'm used to it.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Tired.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
Will they give him a trial?
I am the clitoris.
My head hurts.
Fragile?
I said -
Very funny!
How the fuck should I know!!
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Oh.
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
YOU DO?!
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Help yourself prickfuck!
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Eric?
Something big, children.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Uhh...
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Then move out of the way.
Dude, what the hell is going on?
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
How do we do that?
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Wow!
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Cheers, Terrance!
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
You would know, dummy.
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
I know, Terrance. I know.
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
I know.
Don't call me dumb!
Hey, relax guy!
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
And ze rope?
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
I'm sure I will.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Taylor, you surprise me.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
I know, I know.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Seen one like it before?
You're right.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
I'll do my best.
Hopefully sooner than later.
We have room!  Let's go!
Try not to think about it.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
He's in the bathroom.
How am I supposed to know?
The engines!
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
The pin machine?
Nope.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
It's mine.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I got a right. You're my father.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
The small ball.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
You got a better offer?
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hello, mom?
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Buzz Fazeli.
Who's there?
You shouldn't touch her.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Look who's talking!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Yippy!
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Mine, and they never tip.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
It's a vicious cycle.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Not while I'm in training.
No. Do You?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
Well, that was plan A.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
More than you could afford.
Too late for what, Sheila?
He's my father.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I am a professional man.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Please, Dr. Levine.
Back away then.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Two and a half days?
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
But she's --
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Captain.
Storm?  What storm?
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
It's impossible.
It doesn't make any sense.
What team?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I don't know.  That's the point.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
-- and then brought her down here --
Jerry?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Pull it.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
What?
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
What's the message?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What do you make of this?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
To what?
What's inside the sphere.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Underwater?
Get this thing off me.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
The library.
What?
Yeah, why?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Beth.
So what?
You went through Edmunds' things?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
Manifested?
What?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
But how?
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Something for burns.
Tarazine?
How do you spell it?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
Beth --
You think I'd really drink that?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
It doesn't make any sense.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For whoever's in that thing.
It's an American spacecraft.
I never said that.
We can refuse to talk.
Fine.  I'm fine.
No, why don't --
Wait a second, I --
Look, would you --
Gimme another explanation.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
You didn't say that about the food?
Wisconsin?
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Shut up and open the door.
Hold on.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
That's right.
Please.  It must have flown here --
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
The ships?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
The creature?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
I'm not sure.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I'm beginning not to like you.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
That's where my father was killed.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
We'll send a squad up.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
He'll be well cared for.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Something... I've got...you don't.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
What's the hurry ?
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I got Games & Theory.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
So who's got time to get married ?
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Yeah.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I don't want everyone to see.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
I'll meet you outside.
Who cares ?
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
Should I be ?
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
See you on the bounce !
Thank you, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
What ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Teenagers !
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Here in Buenos Aires.
Courage, I guess.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
I'm gonna save Carmen.
What is it, Rico ?
Kill the bitch.
To join with him.
You may proceede.
The Creator has not answered.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Twelve seconds...!
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Hold relative position here...
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
We're ready, sir.
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
I need a typewritter.
What's it called?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
No, no, I see...
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
...I always thought so...
I love your script.
<u>Yes</u>...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
The other side.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Then I'll come back, then.
You believe that?
I can't get it to come out right.
<u>Please</u>...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
It does?
You'd do the newspaper right here.
Yes...
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Carla was in the car, right?
What is it, a surprise?
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Yes, that's right.
We had a date.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
What?
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
I loved it...he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Of course he...
The Mayor's outside.
Thank you.
I wasn't in the car.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I like you, too.
But we...
Who is that...?
Oh.
Yeah.
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
I can't tell.
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
You said <u>three</u>...?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
What is the...?
Later for you, pal.
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I can only write on a manual.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
You want me to lie.
For what cause?
I left that for you.
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
If you do the product placement...
Is that one hell of a kid?
Is he cool or angry?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Ain't no second chances in life.
Givvem a cigarette...
...we can't lose the wind...
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I killed her!
I don't care.
That will never happen.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
...why do you think?
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Like how?
Well.  It's for you.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
Great.
Oh, yeh.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Here.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
And this is my room so get out!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
Why don't you say hello?
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
Ice cold water.
Cos she loves you.
Fine.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Yes...if you like big hair...
Yes.
Thursday's fine...
No!  I have to get there.
Before you.
You dying.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
You're WHERE?
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
To make it easier for them or you?
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
A lot smaller.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I did it for her.
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Not personally.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Don't flatter yourself.
You're a cross-dresser.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Thanks, but it's under control.
You mean, after I'm dead?
And her...?
Don't be too sure.
Give 'em my number.
Aw.
Worked.  Like a charm.
You weren't passing 'em out.
Oh please.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
We have to talk.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
So I'll have to order in?
For what?
They don't hate you --
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Rache, get out of th...
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
That's not us.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Oh, yeah?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Thanks, Scoob.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
This is work.
My baby.
Poison gas.
I am sure.
I know!
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Yes, Mikey?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Is everything OK?
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Huh?
Oh. What happens now?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Thanks.
Hi, Dad!
Sure, Dad.
Uh huh.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
No.
Thanks.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Yeah?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
We don't have time!
Well Cooper...
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
Shut up!
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
She's as good as gone...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
If I don't get power up we are!
We can't--it's power driven!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
What does that mean?
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Yes, of course.
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
See!  See, I told you.
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Didn't they tell you?
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
That's government property, Major.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Do you recognize my voice?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
A shooting war!
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Yes, sir.
You're right, sir.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Plan-R????
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
That's right, Major.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
That's close enough, Major.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
They're coming in now.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Maybe it's an exercise.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
What?
War?
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
I think they mean business.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Ready, Major.
Very interesting.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Quentin, how's your gear?
Recall what mistake?
Like hell it does.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Sorry, King.
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
But who would be chosen?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
I don't anymore.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Intense.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
What did you guys think?
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Right now?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Okay, okay.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, no.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Uh, last night...
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
No.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Erica is in the van back there.
She's dead.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Guess not.
No.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Really?
Alright, Pony!
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Oh, you were there?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
I'll be in the car, okay?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Mm.
Let's see.
It's a mistake to think that.
Taking care of business.
We were?
Funny shit, man.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Because I'm alienated.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Will you just put the gun down?
Is that Bee-Bee?
Look, your trespassing.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Look, why do you care, huh?
Look, look, just get off my property.
No.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Like what?
Hey!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Typical male.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
Sooze.
Jeff!
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Oh, no, no, no.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, really.
What do you mean?
Burnfield. No place like it.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
It's stupid.
Look at you!
I'm always serious.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah.
That's because I am.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
I think I gotta go.
Where do you get your ideas?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Whatever.
Don't do that, man, okay?
It's none of my business?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
I'm here.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Come on, Jeff.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
It's twins!!
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Spit from your dad?
Yeah.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
He is the Great One...
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Kim-Lo?
Hold on...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Close, but no cigar.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I'll take it.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
As for instance?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Are you hungry?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
I'll make it short.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
It will?
Who's who?
What were you -- a child actress?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
You did.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Get out.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Or teach it a better tune.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I don't know.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Just a scene I cut out.
Okay.
What's wrong with It?
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
"Mad about the boy."
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
I think I'll read a little.
I went for a walk.
Yes, I am, Norma.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
No, they don't.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Madame is waiting.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Good.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
She is upstairs.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
It's what we were warned about.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's for your own protection.
You love me?
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
No.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
But why?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
And you think you're in love.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
I don't want your help.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
Supergirl?
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
I've got things to do.
Theories?
Oh, no thanks.
The scoop of the year!
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Can you create life?
It doesn't seem right.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
A cheap trick.
Not yet.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
There's no vodka in it.
Brad Wilson.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
It sure is.
Too much mayonnaise?
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Me neither...
Call me.
Uh-huh.
Kent!
What!
We get together sometimes.
Sure.
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Who gets it, the company?
One.  And a half.
Uh...
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
They ain't got captains?
Fair's fair.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
Watch out for them air pockets!
We gonna crash?
Just a second.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Sister! I'm his sister!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
You just did, with that great dinner.
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Gus?
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
We already have a super-tanker.
A normal person.
We can get to work on that oil!
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Yeah. I'll check.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Lois, you're amazing.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Oh come on, that's ridic -
We'd better talk.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
It's beautiful.
I asked the right question.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
North.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
What do you want?
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
He ran in fear from us . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Cuba.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Who?
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
This wasn't in the plan.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I am master now.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Bunkers!
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
He's thirty-five years old.
Albert!
I've been on the job.
I know.
Well!
Not really, no.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Jealous? Of what?
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
You?! How about me?
A night on the town instead of under it?
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
He sure as heck does that.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
He'll be weightless.
He will be odd, different.
Enjoyed it?
Twenty-four.
There are none of them any good anyway.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
You think they're strange?
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
What about it?
Uh-huh.
Pink.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I...uh...check.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Of time, Luthor.
Maybe I should get help.
They'll soon be over.
Which one?
She didn't.
That's okay.
Alison.
Why are you telling me this?
Why?
Billy, please.  The children.
How?
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
No.  It should be dry by now.
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Berries.
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
What other people?
Yes.
Hi, Dolores.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
I feel like a princess.
Yes.  It's a present.
Did he say what about?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
Okay.
Okay.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I won't lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Perfect.
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
Yes.
I need money.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
What is it?
Is there shrimp on it?
No.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Excuse me?
You remember that much?
Before the actual accident?
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Positive.
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
You mean it?
Don't even try to remember.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
I don't know.
The Ottos.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Is "he" inside?
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
I doubt that it matters any more.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
See my mother?
Give me a chance --
Hurry back.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Who said Sidney?
J.J., Steve isn't...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
I'll listen one more minute.
Are you finished?
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
What kind of an act is this?
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
The renting agent and the tailor.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
You tell him, I stutter!
Yes, but why?
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Like you?
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, stop it please...
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
No one must follow your work.
My mission is to protect you.
Liquid metal.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
You told me to.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Chill out, dickwad.
Smile?
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Drive faster.
Where you going?!
Yes.  Throw it in.
Gimme that Phillips right there.
No!  Don't kill him!
Alright, it!  We need it!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
SHOOT!!!!
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
So do you.
And Skynet fights back.
Why attack Russia?
Yes.
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
Yes.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Your manner.
Yeah.
With more what? More what?
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Not yet.
No can do.
Yes.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I don't buy that.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
I wish to say something.
And what was that?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
What?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Yeah?
He did?
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Who's he?
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Great.
You're a big help.
That's none of your business.
What's it to ya?
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Freezing.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What's that?
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
You must have had a fun child-
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
Someone?
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Ticklish?
You're not supposed to.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Yes.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
I can't sleep.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
Never mind.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
No.
What's C.R.S.?
... two hundred dollars a toe.
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Well... the red bra.
I thought...
Wha... ?
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
We searched the house.
Stop talking...
Boyfriend?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Elizabeth?
Yeah.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Robbed?
Have you gone to the police?
Yes.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
No, thank you.
What's all this for?
A game?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Fine.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
It was a misunderstanding.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Nothing else?
You warm my heart.
Who's Watts?
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
Luke.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
It was very specific.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
No --
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
Good.
That?  That's Hill House.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Mrs. Dudley.
It's all I could afford.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
I know.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
Well?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I have a loft.
I don't know, you know...
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Then what good is he?
Is that a problem?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
What kind of food?
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I'm a gracious host.
Come over here.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
Terry Valentine.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
This ain't your lot?
Did Jenny know?
She didn't write to me, did she.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Not me, man.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
You goin' back inside?
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
He's gotta know why.
What post office?
Uh-huh.
Really.
Well, those are the breaks.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Not ashamed.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
He give me your address.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, accommodation address.
That's what was estimated.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Depends, don' it.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
You ever been to London?
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
How do you know?
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Eh?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Where else?
Sounds like you need a rest.
Good luck.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Susan.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Be seein' you.
Yes, Ann?
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Hello, Tony.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Birdy--
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Huh.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
I'll have it in a week.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
How's business, Dave?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
So you paid the guy?
I, uh...
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Mm.
Honey...
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
Honey...
I... just knew. A husband knows.
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
So--
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Huh?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
It better be good.
What's the combination?
Let's go!
Hurry up!
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
What doors?
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Call me Vince.
Apparently it's huge.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement?
What is it?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I'd say we're in its home.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
What is it?
Big as a house.
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Keep the animal quiet.
But at what a price.
So what?
Okay.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
Maybe not.
And John?
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
A monster?
Would you mind showing it to me?
You were behind me?  Running after me?
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
It's scared of me.
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
One.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Amnesia.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
Oh, yes.
That's right.  Lauren.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Who?
I told you I can't.
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Yeah...
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
What's that?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
It's a surprise.
I won't be late.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Oh, my God!
I won't be here Sunday.
You blaming me for the traffic?
You're the one talking to the walls!
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
--How do you know about that?
You can count on it.
Yeah.
Yup.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Working with?
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Into what?
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
How?
You can't.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
What's wrong, Scully?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I can't really talk right now.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
-- of what exactly?!
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
About what?
She was with me.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Where's Scully?!
How deep does this go?
Yes.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Lucien Baines?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
No.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Do you think that's funny?
I did, yeah.
If you believe that.
You're sure of that?
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
I got it.
Mocky-Lock.
Delano?
What's wrong?
Sometime yesterday morning.
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Awaiting his arrival.
Completely unaware.
Now?
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Give her some cigarettes.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Need we go through it all again?
What's that?
Tell me more.
Anna.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
We're both in it, Harry.
Me.
I don't know.
How did you know I would be here?
I shall be all right.
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Thank you.
They're Harry's.
There's nothing in them.
And my passport?
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Holly Martins.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
Well?...
How about the doorway?
She's right. It's none of my business.
Take him to Sacher's.
No, I don't know...
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Certainly.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Never heard of him.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Yes.
You can help her.
You wouldn't do anything.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Here?
A Roumanian.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
What's the name of this girl?
Yes.
Hear the details.
I understand...
Who?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Now, hold on.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
What else?
Not necessarily.
Yes.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Help you out?
Good morning.
We moved rooms because of him.
Why?
Fuck off.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Two.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Yes.
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I don't, but...
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
And be crushed.
You gotta get out of here.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
Obviously.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
I agree.
Female...
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Listen to me....
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
A forty-five.
You're lying.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
You do it on the inside....
From the Rhineland originally.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
So what Jew would you kill first?
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
That's meat.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
They're not my people....
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
I've got to get back to the --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
What...?
Wow, that's uh...great...
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
What are you trying to say?
"Do chickens give milk?"
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Valentine...
Fund-raising??
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
No.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
Hello!
In a lake.
Congratulations.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Okay.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
What are you doing here?
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
I won't, I swear.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Everything about what?
... I'm listening.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
Yes.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
... Yes.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
No... in the hut.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
How do you know that?
I did?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Louis, we were French!
... Sally?
Haven't you been listening?
Of course, that's what they're for.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Keep going.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I forgive you.
Mordechai!
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
What about me?
Let's get in your truck.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
What are you doing that for?
Tomorrow -—
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
No. I'm quite sure.
We're old friends.
More or less.
About Charlie's leopard?
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
I don't know.
No.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Don't be soft.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Excuse me?
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Paul Lamont...?
Sorry?
Have you finished?
...You-you spoke to him?
Leon could still have hung himself.
...We’re turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Get to the point, will you...
You wouldn’t understand.
Can you tell me how you spell...
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
A criminal?
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
What about your friendly cop?
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
No... No...  I swear...
I’ll call again.
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Good.
Should I?
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
Your secretary, huh!
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
My rates...
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
He’d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... ‘Sleeping Beauty’. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn’t watch...
Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
No...
I know his work better than I know him.
Could that be Camden Market?
Tu sais où me trouver.
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Fuck...
The acid bath?
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Now?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Tell me...
To marry you.
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
I don't know...
To avoid killing anyone.
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
And when was that?
Performing a miracle.
We want her burned as a witch!
Scared of a girl?
Where... where am I?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
No... I want to be confessed.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Buying her?
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
But... her army's so small now...
... You look wonderful...
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
Go and ask him yourself.
Yes.
For what?
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
The wind will be against us...
We're taking back the Tourelles!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
No... not like this...
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
I'd sooner die than use magic!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
I said, kneel!
No.
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
I don't think so.
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
No...
I need to confess again.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
And what does he say to you?
Yes.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
What are you doing?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
I haven't seen him.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
We use what?
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
They were taking you away.
Yes, so did the Germans.
Yes, but what good did it do?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Bitch!
God forbid!
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
In the attic.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Watch your feet!
Like it were a piano?
Baines is packing up?
Ohh the tag is broken.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
What are they?
It's my mother's piano.
It must come.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hello.
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
He'll probably fall down.
Here.
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Forget it.
Which one?
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
What about the other one?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
I picked something up on the way.
Neither are we.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
No, not a thing.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Then why you doin' it?
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Raise 500.
Raise 5,000.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
No.
Yeh, this time anyway.
All right, when?
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
Give 'em a little time.
I'm in.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Let me talk to him.
Don't think I know him.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Never heard of the place.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Come on, gimme a break.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Another young man.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Don't cry.
Do you think I care
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
And I'll give then proof!
He's waiting for you.
Hello, there!
Yes.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Disappeared!
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
He's been dead for three months.
Yes, she would.
He's all right.
She could tell you where father is.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
What'd he think it was to you?
Man to man, I'm not.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Who's your candidate?
I think we're on the right track.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Nunheim!
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Rosebreen.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
No.
When was that?
Goodbye.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
But suppose some business comes up...
Is Julia going with you?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
If you like 'em like that.
That's jolly.
At breakfast.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I don't believe he did it.
Looks like a hold-up!
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Goodbye, darling.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
No, Mr. Charles.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Maybe she has.
Oh, God.
We're going to keep driving.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
For climbing.
We can't just go off and--
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Ready when you are.
What about the gold?
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
You don't know that.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I've got no stomach for murder.
Suppose I don't go for that?
We thought--
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
What are you doing?
OH MY GOD!
I did it!  I got the box open.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Wh-what do you think--
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I heard it click.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
We're going to be right over here.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Stay low.
Just stay down.
They can't shoot us in here.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
We'll find our way.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
You still got a map on you?
It's got to be going better than this..
You sure you want me too?
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Don't you touch it.
Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
And then what?
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
Shi'ites, I think.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
He's going to slow down.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Like I said; so?
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Yeah, we're down.
I think we found something.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
No!  Don't go.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
We're leaving.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
Incredible!
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
What?
That way.
What kind of answer is that?
All the insides are gone!
No?
No......  She's dead THX........
I'm only trying to help you.
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Hang on.
You the Bomb Squad?
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
I don't know. You tell me?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Your partner?
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Off the scale.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
People are dying.
A ticking bomb...
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
I promised her she'd be safe.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
About tonsils.
No.
Amsterdam?
You've never been in Constantinople?
Umm.
The type they marry.
Nice suit.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
I hope so, too.
Um-hum!
I've got to see you.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Just as you say, Doctor.
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
No--proud. Very proud!
Thank you.
No, thank you.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Seven and nine!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Yes!  Now don't worry!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Yes.
I know that niche.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Peaches and cream.
No. What is it? Tell me.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
You think that's too much?
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Hair?
I <u>must</u> go.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Call the police?
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Jacques!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
For all the really important things--
How much is your salary?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
He started it.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Lewis...
Don't drop it Rose.
Rose Calvert.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
I know what ice fishing is!
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
A mistake?
You're right. Only you can do that.
He does landscapes.
Au contraire, mon cher.
This is crazy.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
I'll be right back.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Just tell us what you can --
Sure!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
I'll join you later.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Baloney!
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Montana?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Guess again, copper.
We'll be expecting you.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
I'll say she is!
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
So you washed it off!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
You work too fast for me, young man.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Sally--!
You mean that?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
You can live that down, can't you?
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Jimmy!
What's the matter?
I thought you were a smart guy.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
I'll watch for him, sir.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
--there's thousands of 'em!
No, sir?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
I'll take one. 
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
It's a pleasure.
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Sure, I'll go.
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
How?
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
I thought I put you to bed.
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Yeah--
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Are you happy?
Everything O.K.?
What do you mean?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Somebody's got to do it--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Not a chance--I'm through. 
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
It all depends on what you're used to.
Telegrams.
Let me look at it.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Nice voice.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Maybe even my destiny.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
Where do you think?  I stole him.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
This brand.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
In pace requiescat.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Better.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
But Doc-
Sorry, sorry...
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
No...
That's great coming from you.
Awful lot of money.
There's no reasoning with him.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
No really, I can stay a while.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
You wanted to talk?
'Least they don't scare women.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Drop his horse.
So he can tell the story.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
That didn't sound like thunder.
You're on.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Sure...
But she doted on the frowner
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
They're carrying guns in town.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Wyatt...
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
And still not a thing to watch.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
- We all want what we can't have?
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Is this another one of your games?
Nothing.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Political considerations?
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
Hey - the world is my office.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Who knows? Fog, night...
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Three. You? Married?
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
I hope so.
What?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
You are seriously deranged.
Don't say it.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
I didn't say when I want to die -
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
What's wrong?
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
...I see.
Excellent.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Who is it?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Maybe. Maybe not.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Yes.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
Do you think you won?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Go back to sleep.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
Hush.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
You must have been really sick.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
You should go back and rest.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
You must have done something to her.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Bye, house.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Rocky!  The ramp!
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Watch yourself!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Excuse me.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
You mean that happy child?
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Don't tell me what to do!
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Yeah, right.
Woody!  The rocket!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Miss.  G-6.
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
Toss 'im overboard!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Yes SIR!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
That's right.  Your toys.
No, Slink --
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
I did like the music.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Let me in.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
So did I.
So had I.
Nothing is left but us.
Storms?
It's all right, Finn.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
I don't know what you mean.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
I can't find Manolo.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Nine thousand dollars.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Arnie, thank God.
Arnie, this is crazy.
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
What?
Me, too.
Why?
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
She asked me not to.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
Caroline --
What do you think?
Hi.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Sixteen
So does half of San Diego.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Not Tiger Woods.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
So you pay off our customs officials?
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
You're breaking my heart.
I don't know, sir.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I don't believe you.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Who?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
If I can.
Everybody has a weakness.
It's possible.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
She hasn't called you?
You won't say anything to my parents?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Like you protected Landry?
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
What kind of research?
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
I'm going home.
No, not holding hands.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Are you clean?
Smells like it.
Too young for what?
It's Iggy Pop.
Unless you get caught.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Aye.
No, I'm clean.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Give me the gun.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
It was just an idea.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
Four Grand.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
As you wish.
But where?
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
A Federation starship.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Oh, please.
Understood. Kirk out.
It's all I have.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
If we could send a distress signal...
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
MM.?
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Yes, Spock?
Goodnight, Doctor.
Yes.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
Yes, Captain?
Let me do something.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Welcome aboard, Captain.

Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I belong here.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Hi, Flynn.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Okay, okay...
To warn him.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
I'm sorry -
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
If you think -
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Greetings, program...
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
How 'bout yourself?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
You're getting out of the business?
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Strategic Air Command.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
End of line.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Do it!
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Where are you off to young lady?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
What?
Here, check these out.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
No way.  Not Dana.
Stay on him.
Son of a bitch!
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
You want me to just hang-- ?
It can't be.  Not Helen.
It can't be.
Put a tap on her phone.
What are you talking about?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
You tell on me, I tell on you.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
Yes sir.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Is that why you got into this business?
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Oral hygiene?
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Me too.
Yeah, it was wild.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
What'd you do, honey?
They must've just missed me.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
He needed my help.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
What did you need?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
No.  Doris.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Yes.
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Those idiots.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
I understand.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
What is it you need me to do?
I just glances inside.
Find out who this Renquist it.
He wants to speak with you.
This is great, we got cable.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Don't eat anything.
Ya looked through it?
Get it.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What do you do?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Very much. Now, where were we?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
What?
Heard that.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
So you do eat pussy!
Can you live with it?
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
No thanks.
You got it.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Ask him if he got the letter.
Tell me.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Let me handle this.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
No shit? Dick, that's great!
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Look, Dick, I don't -
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
I guess so. Follow me.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
She seems very nice.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
What?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Who is he?
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Uh-huh.
Sure was.
Not a tiny little vial -
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
- Because it's good!
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Do you know where we can find him?
No.
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
You're still a little... disoriented.
What are you going to do with us?
So that...???
I need to go now.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I need to go.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
No.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
I...I...We need cash, James.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
You... you left them a message?
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
I need to make a telephone call.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
Christ!
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
That's my morning's pay.
I need a ticket.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Time.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
What's it to you?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Let me have a Beck's.
Yes.  Yes it is.
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
They look nice.
You didn't hear something?
May I carry your package, Grace?
You sure you can manage?
You're welcome, Grace.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I guess it must.
You just walk away.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
From?
How much money has he got?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
What was I supposed to do?
Don't yell at me!
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
You heard me.  Count it out.
I'll get it.
What for?
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Would I what?
No.
I do.
And what does that make you?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
And tell her what?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
You came to take my wife from me?
Come on, Jake--
Christ, Jake, please--
You're not talking sense.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
She's dead.
How old are you?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
A hundred-forty-five really.
I guess.
Not as bad as it looks.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
No!
You want something?
Christ no!
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
Who's cursed?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
You afraid of the dark?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
You expect me to believe that?
Stand up.
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Grace, tell him.
You broke my nose!
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
An overheated car.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Like you don't know.
Would I what?
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Oz.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Get away from me!
Nope.  Darrell.
He's up at the Look Out.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
What?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Darrell.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
I want my car.
Eh?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You should be more careful.
No trouble at all, really.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
Like you.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Still playing?
How do you know he's still not here?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Nothing.
Try me.
There is no us, remember?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
You could give me my gun back.
My mother died in this canyon.
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
No baby, you got it wrong.
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
I said come on!
I want my lawyer!
I'll keep it in my office room.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Jesus.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
It's finished. I won.
But not a knife?
Like what?
You're skill.
One last question.
That's not what I witnessed David.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
What's he look like?
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
I won't make any noise.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
How much can you lift?
All of it.
I see.
You're lying.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
No?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Innocent of what?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Nope.
You ain't dead.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Advances?
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
He admit it?
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
What's your name?
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
And?
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Well... I don't recollect.
First one what?
You ain't shot.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Huh?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Two weeks, I guess.
You ain't like that no more.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
How far kin you see?
Yeah... you said that last night.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Best we move that pig.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Thought you was followin' me.
Nothin's bent.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Yeah?
Maybe.
We'll bury him.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
There's more.
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
They ruined me tonight.
A glass of water would be nice.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
You are a criminal.
Can we stealth these guys?
Not if we do it my way.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Two hours, tops.
Someplace else, then.
I just want to hear your story.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
No.
What lawyer?
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Why didn't you say anything?
I said I never heard of him.
Because he was my friend.
I'm fine.
Yes.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
And no one will know the truth.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
I was her doctor.
Yes.
That's right.
...We did everything we could...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Nothing further, your Honor.
I wouldn't do it.
I...yes.
I...
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
'Code Blue'...
Well...
The Doctors were not negligent.
It was good of you to meet...
...I made a reservation at...
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
Right.  Who called?
... and you're going to do that?
Why?
Her doctors killed her.
No.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
That happens.
Ready, your Honor.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes.  Price...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Maybe what?
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
You, you don't under...
I have to talk to you.
He's not in, Sir.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I'm swell.
I don't want a mistrial.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
I did.
We, we were rather busy...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
And when she goes to those places...
Did she hurt herself?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Okay.
Tomorrow morning.
Don't go.
No.
Honest?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Is that the best you can do?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
How does it work?
Oh, yeah. There.
To complete my cure.
I need you.
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Yes!
Your accident...
What are you going to do?
Some money.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Why?
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
My name is John Ferguson.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Some people prefer it.
Not at all, I enjoyed --
What?
Good-bye.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
I don't like them.
Yes...
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
Vaguely...
I know.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
And it's a all real.
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
Too late... there's something I must do...
To the church, I must go there.
I won't lose you.
Carlotta Valdes?
How long has she had the room?
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
More than you think.
It's where you belong.
Three whole weeks.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
How?
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Do you know him well?
For what?
Carlotta?
Bye-bye!
Where?
Oh... this and that.
Wandering.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
I need a drink.
What did you say?
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
You're an asshole.
You fucking bastard!
Why?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
So I didn't fucking do it!
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
I am not flexible on this.
At the seven-eleven.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
I don't give a damn.
They're driving me nuts!
Later.
There is no candy!
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
I know...
What.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
So where's that leave us?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
The groom?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
I'm not talking to you?
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
No.
Shut up.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
I'm calling the police.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
He is not cracking up.
What did you ask me?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Hear what?
It's my fucking opinion.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Moore?
True.
What's your point?
Not really, no.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
What?
I think so.
Sent it.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
Well it's bad timing.
He's quiet.
Of course.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
I will.
I love you.
No. Just like an hour or so.
I'm working on it.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Well, can you come back inside?
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
Move the bodies.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
I love you dad.
I just want her to be happy.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
What?
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace?
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
It's a present from my parents.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
That one.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Yes, sir. Good night.
What's the matter?
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
Yes, sir.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
He was asking for it.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
What are you going to do?
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
Why did he kill himself?
Why?
Are you Jorge?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Very, very?
He couldn't get through the door, then?
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
Mother.
I had so many things to think about!
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
I've had a gutful of this.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Today, a good girl.
Me? What did I do?
But only you will know he's not human.
I'm getting by.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Their weapons missing?
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I'M WHAT?!
You're...such a wimp.
How do you kill it?
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
Help me get out of here.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Start of what?
You like baseball?
You don't know?
Lindenmeyer?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
Duck!
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
For Schumann.
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
All I need is the one day.
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
And you?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost? 
...that's the general idea.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
...<u>nothing</u>...
What did Albania ever do to us?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
I'll play your silly game.
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
The... 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
Because.
"Freedom."
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Might, if I was asked... 
Of what?
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
...but...
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
Take ten.
See y'at the Finish Line.
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
Surest thing you know.
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
Yes. 
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
Please, no thanks... 
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
...gotta read my reports.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Get the hell out!
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
I met them before you were born.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
So you're hot on this stock?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
He never told me...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
What? How do you know about my father?
Yes...
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Obviously...
Gordon.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
...how do you know? You wish...
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Businessman!
Yeah, yeah, OK
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
About what?  About us.
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Hmm.
Thank you
Thank you
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
They seemed, closing by much 
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Safety in numbers man.
Right behind you.
Hi there Sarah
Well divide 18 into three
Sell my soul?
Maybe before the event, never after.
They're all human beings
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
It's only two hours away.
I'll come back all the time.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
That's not true.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
What do you think?  Guess.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
I came in from my room...
Good.  I'm good.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
Yep.
What?
I think so
It's alright.
Please.
All of us.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Norman Spencer.
It's Saturday.
I am, really.
Not the focus.
Of him I think.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
That's not what I'm sug--
I know.
Is it gone?
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
Oh, no...
I'm so sorry.
No.  Look!  In the window.
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
What am I looking at?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
In the living room...
Not personally.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
...Please stop...
Claire--
Oh God...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
How did she know where it was?
Don't think so.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
I don't want it.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
When did she die...?
I under5tand.  All the same
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
'He'...?
It wes a dream...!
Stop it!
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
You - are - a - murderer.
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Now, lasher - it is our time.
I bring her flowers too.
It's too soon to know.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Leave me alone!
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
And whose houses do you design...?
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
God knows, I'm intriguing.

What about you coming down here...?
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Mm-hmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
That's not funny.
Lock the door.  Lock it
Stop it!
You bastard!
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Just don't fall off any ladders.
You really love this guy...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
CHIC MAGAZINE?
BRIAN...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I really don't know what to say
Sure...
You don't know?
I don't want to talk about it -
I don't know...
I don't know...
Why should I?
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
STEPHANIE?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
Then make it stop...
Open it...
Out - I may be some time
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
You killed my friend!
It's what you would do to me
At 2.00...
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes - of course.
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes - one please.
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
That's crazy talk.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Astronomical.
Well, Dad said...
Cut it out, before you break something!
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
But that smile.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
Of course we are.
Just say it, Dad.
You ordered a Winnebago?
I will not have my boys arguing.
Hmmm?
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
Very funny.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You're quick. I like that.
I'll make you very proud.
Forget the store. Think big.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Rules are rules.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Of course I like girls.
Seldom? No kidding?
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
I was like a different person tonight.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
He was in a league of his own.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
I... You know... I...
And where might that be?
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
He was large?
No.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
I net a guy in a bar.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
You have someplace to be?
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah, but...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Whichever one I want.
No you don't.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Why can't you come...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
I did.  At Blue Balls.
About what?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
That's right.  That was his name.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Aha?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
It's better than nothing.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Thank you.
I'm sure we will.
But it only has six legs.
We'll see.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Your guests, ma'am?
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Would that include me?
I've had some practice.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
You bring the best out in a man.
No, sir... just a businessman.
I deal with some tough customers.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
They're coming.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Then come with us.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Me?
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
He's no magician.
I will!  But I need help!
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
As above, so below.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Of course!  I promise!
Time to leave.
You?
Ahhh!
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
That's all I ever wanted!
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Burn it to a fine ash.
Shhhhh!
Why?
Shut up.
Who is he?
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
The sorceress.
They're Amish.
Yes, sir.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Who else knows?
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Home.
You tell him. When you're able.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
But... You may not be well enough.
I admit I don't know where he is.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
I don't know where he is.
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
No...
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
My son is out there!
If she...
If any!
You'll be hist...
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
You are?
Oh ....
Hickory!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Toto, too.
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
How did you guess?
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh -- yes.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Stop her!
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh...
Oh --!
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Yes...!
You're right -- I am a coward.
Oh.
Yes.
But why?  Why?
Huh?  What'd he say?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
It's too late!  There they....
Don't you start it, too!
Now...
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Whozat?
You mean she bit you?
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
We do.
A heart --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Oh - look out.
We'll get you together!
Oh --
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Go on!
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
Help!
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
But what if...
The worm on the hook again.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Yes.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He’s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I know.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
No. You’ll be safe here.
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
Shush.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
He used your exact words.
You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
How appropriate.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Your father...
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Washington?
Don't call me that.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Veidt¹s complex.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
What if you¹re wrong??
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
His . . . whatever.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
The costumes.  Am I right?
That's because --
Those cars.  What year is this??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
With lots of ketchup?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
We're not after car thieves here.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Who says you're the good guys?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
He gets to be the hero.
I'm from L.A.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
You don't have to do that.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
They come in any other styles or colors?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Is this what you're looking for?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Of course.
This is a gift. From me to you.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
Had to do what I had to do.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
We all do.
Beast.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
What if I like the pain?
Not interested.
Suit yourself.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I've seen a lot of rings.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
What do you want with him?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
The way what is going to be?
Ugly, vicious rumous.
From your office, sir.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Well... yes.
I...
Surprised!
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
That's my good boy.
It seems fine.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Why did you do that?
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
A piece of what?
My father was a sick man.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Yes, just the two.
What wockers?
Fro-derick!
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Why?
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
Who are you talking to?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
Don't fall for that one.
You can say that again.
... I'm glad that's...
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
How do you know it was a 'he'?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
That's what we're paid for.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Well, this explains the music.
What do you think we should do?
I see what you mean.
And I have mine.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Yes.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Food!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
But will they make good use of them?
Yes.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
