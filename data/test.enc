Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Why?
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
There.
Hi.
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Wow
They do to!
Where did he go?  He was just here.
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
It's more
Hey, sweet cheeks.
I just wanted --
But she doesn't want to date.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
That I'm used to.
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
You makin' any headway?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
It's about time.
Hey.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You think this'll work?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
hey.  Great show, huh?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
I say, do what you wanna do.
You're not okay.
Why?
Dorsey.
Kat! Wake up!
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Tell me something true.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
That ' s completely adorable!
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
As a parent, that's my right
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
In the microwave.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
You can see for yourself.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
How far from here?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I have to explore the mainland.
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You defend yourself admirably...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
Chief says -- how many?
To bring the word of God.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I have to disagree.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Where can I meet this man?
We're lost!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
I'm coming with you.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
...delusions and paranoia.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Your mother was blind?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What are you asking me?
Do you have coffee?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Chief - mind if I take her?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
You know what that is, right?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Why not?
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
I kill someone famous.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Alright.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Promise?
Okay, til tonight.
Thank you.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Okay.  You ready?
And what do you do with the bones?
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Get in the bathroom!
I'm serious.
You got that?
Emil???!
It's easy to learn.
You've got a call.
Isn't he a little moody?
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
A cheap hotel.
No.  Go ahead.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
How did you start the fire this time?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
What are you gonna do?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE

That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Yes, I thought so.
Two more.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
CONINUED
CONTINUED
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Really?
That's right.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Fortunately, they did.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Thank you.
That's true
That's true.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I never paid for it in my life.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You're gonna help us take him.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Yeah?
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Half a million.
He's after your money.
Right, partner.
Where's the goddamn car?
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
We missed.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
That was quick.
You okay?
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
That's what you say, Cates...
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Bullshit red tape.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Whaddya think?
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
How hot are they?
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Of course.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
Uh... at least fifty.
Hello?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
...Priest...
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Yeah?
Hello?
...Ma???
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
30 seconds...
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Is that all?
...Shit!
It's my wife.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Apipoussan?
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Tell me...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
Is that better?
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Am I disturbing you?
How's our deal coming along?
How's the detective business?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Tom...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
What?
Snuff?
What do you want?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Who is this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
He's lying.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Truman Capote.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
How much do you make now?
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Alright, I get the picture.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Uh huh, pleasure.
It won't work like that.
Nothing remotely like this.
Hello... ?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Do you know what happened to her?
Her belongings?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
You alright?
We'll figure it out.
I'm sure they're around.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
So?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Something wrong with the stairs?
What is it?
You don't get it, he's after me...
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Where is he?
The tickets.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Where are we going?
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
I thought about that.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
How is he - ?
My father!  He's not - ?
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
I don't know.
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Excuse me, Skipper---
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
Swell!
He did!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Always has been.
Who?
You don't believe me?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
This spring.
Oh.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Guaranteed, eh?
Mmm.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Open the door. We're late.
You know.
What then?
No what?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
It's pretty old.
How about a Big Mac?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You? Why?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
It's just...
Good. Who?
I still don't understand --
You okay?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Then... I guess you have to.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Of course! I would've heard.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Going somewhere, Margie?
You're not using it today?
It makes me sad.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Something about my father?
Marg!
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Get some sleep.
Then who shot him?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
He didn't leave us.
How was...  ...the ballet?
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Put your pilot on.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Got it.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Can we do that?
Why?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Who did this?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
*                     Please tell me your name.
What do you know of my husband?
Stop.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
May I speak to you for a moment?
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
Someone should give you a raise.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
Where's my family?
Thank you for calling the white House...
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Did you feel that?
Oveur.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine.
Ted, we're taking off!
What are you doing, Ted?
Elaine.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
He's a boy dog.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
All right, it's a matter of death.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Captain, how soon can we land?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Elaine!
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
What's his problem?
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
You okay?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
He didn't recognize me.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Nothing?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Back off, George.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
I believe he is probably lying.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
Where'd you get this?!!
Well, let's roll, George.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
How do I look?
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
You think this is the guy who did it?
That where Anderson worked?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
What?
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Okay, let's do it.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Could it be intelligent?
I'll go.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's the question?
Seventeen meters.
Let's go!  Let's go!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
Range twenty meters.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
What did you say?
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Are we going to sleep now?
Look, I told you...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Maestro.
What's that?
Did you know? Had you heard?
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Hardly.
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Where?
Now?
No! No! No!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
That's stupid.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Yes!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Yes, my love?
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
No. Don't answer it!
Frau Mozart?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
These are originals?
What are you doing here?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
This is not his handwriting.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
He's adorable!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I said play!
What a charming idea. May I see?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
My pleasure.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Oh, thank you.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Why so?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
What do you mean, Sire?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Well, what do you have for me today?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Why not?
You don't have secrets from me.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
What medicine?
What?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
I'm afraid I am.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Do you have a daughter?
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
How fortunate.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Did my work please you?
Yes?
How long will you give me?
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
Would you? Actually, you could.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
That's wonderful!
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Oh? Have I seen it?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Are they?
Is it true?
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
No, you didn't!
Oh my son, my poor son!
He's setting that play to music?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Oh, Miss Price?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Did he say a wolf?
Yes.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
No, why?
Shall I send a car?
It wasn't a lunatic.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
How old are you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Are you better now?
My friend Jack was just here.
I was dreaming again?
The kitchen.
But, David.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
I've left those pills for you.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
The next corner we can get a cab.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Hello, Benjamin.
No what?
Who is this girl?
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
How long have I been here?
Two weeks?
Lunatic?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Nice looking group.
Jack, we'd better go.
Heathcliffe.
No, but he was on the moors.
Where are we going?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I'm going completely crazy.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
It's you, David.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Hi, Jack.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
No, thank you, Doctor.
Excuse me.  Yes?
What here?
What's that?
Oh.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Let me have ten bucks?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Oh!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Yes, of course.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Why - well, I—
Longer.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Good morning, Helen.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Well, I—
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
Why pick on him ?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Yes, sir.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
Yes.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
What did you find out, Mike?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Where's Charlie?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
This is healing?
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
Yesterday.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Not now.
Thanks for the help.
The James-Younger Gang.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Beautiful.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
I think one of 'em's glass.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Of St. Louis?
What the --
You know you're welcome any time!
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Distracting enough for you?
Web's dead.
She's still talking to Jesus.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
We're drunk.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Can't argue that.
How much of that story is true?
Did you kill Yankees?
Easterners.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
But still died.
You're sick of my company?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Yep.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Don't turn around.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
I like that.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Not at all.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
With my money!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
What the hell is that sound?
I know. Stop it.
Pick me up?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Are we here?
Luis is a despicable twit.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Patrick?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
He's good-looking.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
You're really serious, aren't you?
But what about the past? Our past?
You're inhuman.
I think you should go now.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
SHUT UP!
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Dorsia, yes?
I said we are totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Oh, something. . romantic?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
You don't like this, I take it?
Jean?
Anywhere you want?
Jean? Sorbet?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Well.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Oh no, I'm okay.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
He had a yacht?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Have you consulted a psychic?
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
So...you hang out here a lot?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No hash browns?
I've questioned him.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Speak up. Come on.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What!
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
That was -- different.
Here we go.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
Okay.
...When did you know?
Milo? I'm Danny.
How's it going?
It's okay. Really.
Milo. What's up?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
I'm okay. It's going well!
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Every entry was authorized.
What're we looking for?
Lisa.
You know mine.
Cool!
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
I snuck into #21.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
...Milo?
What about the FBI?
Do we post it on the Net?
Time?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Maybe it's the satellite.
Is that how Larry feels?
Did you tell Alice?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
What're they building?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Come in.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Yes?
Yes?
Hello, Exposition.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
What's wrong with your hand?
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Fancy a nibble?
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Who?
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I love you, Austin.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Commander, I have to log it...
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
An evil petting zoo?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
What do you want to do, Scott?
Really?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Nature ...
Hope...
Then you can't come in.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Much better.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
I thought we were on our way.
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Is that what you think?
Do you always drive this fast?
Steed ... !
Because you always obey orders ...
And do you trust me?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
What is it?
I'll be back ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our chaperon.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Where's Mother?
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
Privately owned by ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Oh, hello ...
Steed
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Mrs. Peel -- ?
One shot -- for emergencies.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
And...
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I love that car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Nice shot.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
No, Cole, I...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
What are we having?
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Give him the works.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
So, Larry, how have you been?
What the hell are you doing?
Feel free.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
What the hell is that?
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Debbie.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Wash it to the windows?
Did you do it for Tim?
It doesn't go like that.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Been ripping off fire stations?
Sheep don't count.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
Anything else?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Huh.
I work for city hall.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Hey.
I could use a date.
I was doing my job.
Hi.
I don't know anything about it.
I'll see ya around, huh?
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
-- Shhh.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Then who wrote the report?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Just wondering.
Brian?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Every little boy's fantasy.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Do you have to do that?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
He just wants to --
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
He treats you okay?
Yeah? When was the last time?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
-- Burn them.
-- Burn them.
I'm working on it.
You don't know... nobody knows...
It knows us. This one knows us.
Inspector.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
People.
Yeah.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
Are you all right, honey?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
How's the case going?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Yeah, him.
You don't have the demographics.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
We're ready when you are.
You're in this up till ya neck.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
That ain't funny.
What do I have to do?
Mantan?
I won't do it anymore.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Four minutes ago.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
That's what I'm askin'.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
So what's up with you?
How did you know?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Hello.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
This is the group I was telling you about.
Same here.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
For what?
This is crazy.
Don't make me have to use this.
Hi, Mona.
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
You feel good, not nervous?
How's the food?
Mommy, please don't call me that.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Finland.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
How did you get this gig?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Let Myrna finish.
Yes you!
So what's up with you and DeLa?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
No, not that.  How 'bout...
...perfect...
I don't know who I am.
What else?
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
Why don't you call him?
You're sure this is a good idea.
How did you get this gig?
O'Grady.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
All Europe shall hear of this!
For whom else have you worked?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
I believe they will deport you.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Then you yield to me.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I feel the ribbon.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Papa?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Did -- did you --
What about Pike?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You saved Kendall's life --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
He said he worked there --
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
Right?
Bullshit.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
He admitted it.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Is it the truth?
Something funny, Levi?
Why?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
You think you could explain all this to me?
Stay where you are.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Move him.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
Baseball?
You made me look like an idiot --
You're off to a late start.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
For what?
No bodies, no West...
What?
West?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Maybe we shouldn't go.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Dunbar says you were.
What the fuck happened to you --
I used it to start the fire --
So?
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
You were expecting me?
What is this place?
The poet? What ever happened to him?
I have to leave. Tonight.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Then do it.
How would you describe him?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
You must be Edward Bloom.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
I'll...
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
Karl.
You don't like it?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
The one about the witch.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
You owe me three-fifty.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Let's get out of here.
It's unbelievable.
Wait! I need those!
You need to go.
I'm going with you.
I talked with your father last night.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
I need you on my side.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Was she one of your teachers?
Is he awake?
Mom?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
So you never bought any land.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
Yeah it was okay.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Yes.
What? What are you doing?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Sorry. You've lost me...
Right.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Binoculars.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants a lot of money.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
I don't understand.
"Frenzy".
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
Give me some money.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
I don't hate you.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
What?
You don't understand me.
You are throwing me out.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
I'm sorry.
Okay. Goodbye.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
No. What? No. I know.
What does it mean?
Is the flight full?
You have excellent English.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
What do you need?
Hi.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
The fuck you laughin' at?
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
I keep the heat on.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Or what? OR WHAT?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Like a man.
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Where's Ronnie?
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
You some kind'a pervert?
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
LET ME GO!
I said... STOP!
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Tell me what to do.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
What is it?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Shit. Who hasn't?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
The hell is this shit?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
You a preacher?
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
What?
I'm a what?
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
You got any money?
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
I think she got to you, pappy.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
What's this?
What are you doing?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Let's go.
Joyce can be nice.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
You must leave?
Know her?
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
How many men?
Joyce?
Thank you.  You have one?
I'm sorry.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
She ever pull down her shades?
Don't be an ass.
I need your help, Joyce.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
I still think you're a bastard.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
She's such a long way home for you.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
It's not your job.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
One man.  He must be good.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
What generation are you?
You could help us.
He could?
What's going on down there?
Yeah.
Well, when do you get paid?
When might that be?
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
What about a summary then.
Number three.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I like you.
One more, eh?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Nerves of steel.
Why didn't you go?
My job is here.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
It that mother real?
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Do you dream?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
But then how can you...
You're sick, Deckard.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
May I ask a personal question?
But in your profession that is a risk.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
You look... better.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
My office.
Well, that depends...
What's wrong with you?
Do you own a car?
How's that?
Over this?
I think it's the eyes.
...Okay.
Why not go to work for me?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Very funny, smart ass.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
It does?
I didn't know that.
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
May I please be excused?
The guy with the underpants!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
I'm leaving, too.
There.
I've got to go, now.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
Like one of Mom's?
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Well, do we just go on up?!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Uh-huh.
That's what everybody believes?
You have very nice ceilings.
Right on the button.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
That would knock my father out.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
The recovery is very impressive.
What?!
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
Bye, Troy!
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
You don't look thirty-five.
Help you?
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
I do alright.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
This is your bedroom?
Well, where are you --
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
To go up.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
No.  I think it's just right.
Yes!
Watch this!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
If we still have one.
Yes, yes it is!
Yes.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
He's smart.
What are you bitching about now?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Give me your hand.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I see "elegant."
Just be yourself.
Go to the bathroom.
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
What?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
And if we can't find him?
I don't know. I like to think so.
We came back to the house!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Tower, say again!!
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Who knows you have these?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
What do you want from me?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
You can hit me, if you want to.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
What do you want to do?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
You what?
Yes.
Yeah, it's me.
Hold me, Don.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Hello, daddy.
Where are we going, Frank?
Hello?
No thanks.
What are you lookin' at?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Yeah?
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hi Dad.
How is Central these days?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I've gotta go in.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
OK.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
What did you see?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay, be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Okay, okay.
Shoot.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You didn't tell him about me?
What was that all about?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Sandy?
Look Jeffrey.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Are ya ready?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
You think they sold me out? No way.
Yeah, well...
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
What? What is it?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Hello.
How's Uncle Sibeal?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Would someone please come over here and...
me up the...
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Destroy all that which is evil...
I'm serious.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Oh, we're good man.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Yeah?
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Promise me boys.
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hello?
Liberating isn't it?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
We'll keep going, Roc.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
What does Starsky say?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
She's really kind of hot.
Where are you going?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
But he didn't say anything.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
There's another stocker, right?
What's wrong with him?
Can I get that credit card from you?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Yes, they are.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
May I have a word with you, please?
Which one was that?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
He's gone. He stole the car.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Sixteen dollars.
You could give somebody a concussion.
What do you think?
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Yeah. As a girl.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Where's Kumar?
There's not enough time.
I think I may have found a way out of here.
That was a test?
Did Dignan take the test?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Did you ever steal a car before?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Hector woudn't do anything.
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
Anthony, I --
What?
What are you doing?
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
That's Anthony.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Bob.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Did we get it?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
You really think he'll remember you?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
Yes, I do.
Bob, you're lying!
I'm sorry, Bob.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I might have mentioned it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
You keeping out of trouble?
The grammar?
We're closed, sir.
I don't know.
No. Just pool.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Let's talk about Conklin.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Berlin!
Sorry to wake you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
She say what time I should call?
That's not what happened to your parents.
What do you want?
What's going on in Berlin?
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
-- it hasn't been two years --
Sleep. Sleep now.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
What do you want?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
You didn't answer my question.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
You're sure?
What kind of problems?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Did you?
Some women like Dobermans --
But... what will you do?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
What is it?!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
When will his trial be?
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
You know it's a trap.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
You'll move
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
I'm not just saying it!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I've missed you.
Tonight then.
Then when?
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Peace is made is such ways.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
You will die! It will be awful!
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Who would do such a thing?
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
What?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
What happened?
I... I blacked out.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Oh God... what did we do?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
I know, but...
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
I don't get it.
Then you think it might have worked out?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Are you sure you even packed it?
What?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Listen to me good, Evan...
Lung cancer?
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
So you decided to go to America.
Nobody ever loved me that much.
You want my advice?
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Yes, I come.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Did he give any reason?
Yes.
Rick? Who's he?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
Your work.
Good morning.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Well, this might come in handy.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Even in Berlin.
For the time being.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Mademoiselle.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
Hello, Louis.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
He is traveling with a lady.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Yeah, you were saying?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Oh, no, Rick never --
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I have the letters right here.
I have. Sit down over there.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
Nobody remembers that.
Get up.
Get water!
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
You can't make it.
You know what happened to this?
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Chuck.
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
He is a cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
"We're" not over-reacting.
No.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Get back?  From where?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that, written on the sail?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Yes, yes he did.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Trying.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
I was making a point.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
How many months are you?
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
People watched the movies in their cars?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
And what did she die of, exactly?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
I *know* this was right.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
I love you, Wally.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
I thought they might take me.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
*Liver* killed him?
Did you bite it?
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
What business is you in, Homer?
What's that? What's it called?
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Rose Rose has runned away!
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
We had to finalize the deal.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keeping the Fix happy.
Like what?
She had you tempting fate.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Ten is standard, sir.
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
I'm going home
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Calls?
So that's it...
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Minus one.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
How much?
Excuse me?
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Sorry, I --
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Attractive girl.
Oh Jesus!
What about... The money?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Mr. King, I think --
Uh... Everything okay?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
It's bad luck.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
Uh...
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
And we got rid of the red head.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
Can I speak to you in confidence?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Who?
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
I got scared.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
The Indian rope-trick.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
What?!
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
All right. As what?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
I couldn't resist them.
Where did you get it?
It came my way. 450 a week.
Are you trying to read my palm?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Without hope there's no point to anything.
The door, Jack.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
Really?
What?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
Which side do you like?
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
And I thought you were only after my body.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
I want you to forget what I said.
Is it yes?
Detective Inspector Ross.
You've been avoiding me.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
She's my baby.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
What are you, a cop?
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
And the girls?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Where's the magnet?
Ever?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
I just want the job.
Thanks for the information.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
The key, goddamit, the key!
What the hell?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb...
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
It is intuitively obvious.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Why don't you have more time?
And you can only do it once, right?
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
In a second.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Veil nebula.
-- automatic channels open --
I need a diameter approximation.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
What happened, Doolittle?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
We're running out of time, sir.
Sir?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
What?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Who is...
Lemme get my coat.
How'd you find me?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You got a lotta nerve.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
Well, not me personally.
With your help.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Who are you?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Look, I don't know what you want--
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Morning, Sunshine...
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
A long time.
Gotta go.
Please...
So are dogs.
Not right now.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Playing hooky again?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Right, the big one-oh.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
I want you on call here.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Huh?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
No, I mean... you love your son?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Uh... dudes?
I think we should try sneaking in.
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
It's gone.
But we took the keys?
What do you want?
Two hundred bucks?
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
What was his name?
How can you do that?
Who is... we?
I want to show you something.
What happened to your eye?
How old is Grandma Death?
Don't look so freaked.
Where are you going?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Did you call the cops?
What?
Come with me.
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
People aren't that simple.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
So how was school today?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Where are you going?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Cellar door.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
Follow him where?
How are things going at school?
What else do you think about during school?
What about your family, Donnie?
Can anyone else see him?
Is Callie still around?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Then how is time travel possible?
I can see him right now!
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
If that's what you think is necessary.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Chut up!
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
You-betcha.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Loretta, don't do that.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
This, this... This is bullshit!
What?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I didn't get any.
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Hi...
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
And the year before that?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Oh! What is it?
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
What!
This is -- what?
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
And wear a crown and everything.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
Father...
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Oh no, I can't do it.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
My card.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Anything else? 
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
That's even a greater honor.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Give me that again!
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Your Excellency!
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Oh, Rufus!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
So that's the one you want to marry.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
They have noble faces.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
What do you mean?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
You stay with me.
More romances for John?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
What are you going to do?
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Has the response picked up?
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
You never mentioned his mental state.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Good day...!
Oh, no.
Tell me about it, please!
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yes.
Merrick...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
...Yes potatoes... but...
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
How long will I stay here?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Good morning, John.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Watery headed bunch.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
HE'S GONE!
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
It's your fantasy...
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WHY?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
No... we don't...
A lot of people like our singing.
Really.
We're just not a very musical nation...
I'll tell you what...
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
He wants to kill US!
Have you done this sort of thing before?
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I don't suppose... no...
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Scream.
That's terrible!
I... I... KILLED her...
Slower! In... Out...
Faster!
What did he say?
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
No! Let go, Snorri!
There is another way.
I think we should go...
Wait, Erik!
Well, what else do we do?
What are you talking about, Erik?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Look, I bagged it last week.
She hasn't got any.
Yeah... well...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
It can't do you any HARM...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Get away, Snorri.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
My brother blacksmiths!
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
I should have got rid of you long ago!
So did my father and his father before him.
Well, of course he is!
There is nothing we can do...
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Shut up.
And you've got BOTH axes?
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Thanks, guys.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
And I just liked you so much.
How are you today?
You rat.
Oh, Tangerine.
Why what?
Rockville Center.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I like it.
Yeah.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Frost?
It's pretty.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Yo ho ho!
I don't think we're ready.
I want to know you.
More?
Joely...
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Such a beautiful view.
What if you hide me?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Happy Birthday.
I told her today I need to end it.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
You said...
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think, before.
It's dark.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
What if you stay this time?
When?
Have sex. Y'know --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
You must have been crazy.
How's it going?
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I should maybe talk to you.
How's the chicken?
Naomi.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
Clementine.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
I'm sorry.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Yup.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Hey.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
Oh.
What's this?
Howard, your one o'clock.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
We can't do this.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Mary. What are you doing here?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
What's your bartlett's?
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
What was that?
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Where are the others?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
I'm cold.
Thanks.
Are you in show business?
For magazines?
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Ballast.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
What?
It's holding... She's holding...!
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
What's wrong?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
90 over 50 and falling... .
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
What, Justin, what shows you?
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Jesus its huge.
Peters...
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
What does it say?
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
We've got some weather.
Skipper...
Where is it, where is it...
That's an affirmative.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
Maybe one of the original crew?
Who?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Can you see a body?
He's engaged the override.
What the hell is that?
The safety circuit's failed!
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
What are you doing?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
I'll be watching over you.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
I had it at four.
Isn't that your speech?
Are you alright?
What the --!
You got a chisel round here?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
What?
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
He's not responsive --
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Feeling better?
Which was?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Victor, your scar --
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
How much did they cost?
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
On the ledge?
Easy, mon.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'm just guessing.
You are a virgin!
Any problems?
Dad says you have to get up!
Leave me alone.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Take that back.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Did you get her number?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Hey, Rat.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Did you go home and get it?
Damone, are you there?
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Who's that?
Are you going to ride that wave?
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Don't you like him?
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Well I never did it.
Was it great?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
What do you think?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Where's Doug?
I couldn't make it in time.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
What can I get for you tonight.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
It's very warm out tonight.
I think I better take you home.
Is this your first time?
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Where's your brother?
John Bonham?
Hi, Mark.
Really?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Let's have lunch!
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Shoot it.
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Can we make it?
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
In that case, maybe she can help.
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Well, it don't look pretty.
We'll be food, dickheads!
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And that's how I ended up here.
They're right here.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
You all sure about this?
Where's the tunnel?
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Your parents of relation?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
How are you holding up?
Will I go crazy or something?
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
How much you got?
What? Really?
He's dead.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Four door?
Nine?
Keys.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Fine, Chief.
What?!
Hurry!
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hey!
Okay, well that's something.
Hold it!
Oh my God... What is that?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
What're you doing?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Madam...?
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
What does Clifford say?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
You learn your lines?
There've been some calls.
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Francie, you know I can't do that.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Well? What'd you think?
How'd I look?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
What?
Jesus.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Harry... I met someone.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I should've known...
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
You give up on her?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Where to?
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
And no people.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
I think I need a little air.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Say you promise.
I'm back, Mama.
Don't... talk crazy.
You're not going anywhere!
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Yes...?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Normal. Average.
Is there something else?
Symington says...
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
Why?
You're an outcast.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Your crime... as well as mine.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Friend?
And if I consent?
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Must've been a terrible row.
I should go. I should leave today.
He always was opinionated.
God took her from us.
This feels... incestuous.
Brother and sister still?
I give you my soul...
Victor. I love you,
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor!
I am not mad.
Henry Clerval.
Do you really think I'm mad?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Quite a few.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Now you've got him started.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
How much longer?
Yes? And?
What happened up there?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Philosophical?
Re-configure the leads?
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
How is it you come to be here?
Ah. An explorer.
Your men are right to be afraid.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
What'd you see?
Filmmaker.
It still hurts?
What'll you do when you leave here?
I don't hear it anymore.
It sounded like Brenda.
What's the matter with it?
I'll be along.
You know what I said, though.
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
Thanks.
Ha!
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
It's gonna be a long summer.
What about Neddy?
Don't call him.
It's just a dream.
Mmmmmmmph?
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
I mean...
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Good luck.
How many with you?
What was that?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Twenty-eight.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
Why do you want to stop?
What are you gonna do?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
Why did they block the door again?
What's your name?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Not a chance.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
She's dead?
How'd she die?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Why not, against your religion?
Why are you so agitated?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
What's this stuff?
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
Not good enough, swear to God.
Creepy guy.
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
I'm really sorry.
Watch my back!
Should I use the last bullets on us?
-- see this, television!
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
He says you were scratching.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Do they have cable?
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Of course, but there's more --
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
None at this time, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Straight up?
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
White House boys want a private meeting.
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Uh, question, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Should probably ask him that.
You don't know that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
You'll think about my offer?
Then I suggest we start there.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Just do it, okay?
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
So dump on me.
Jordan...
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
"In Washington..."
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Who is it?
You really came back for more?  Of this?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Say again?  How many micks?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
You don't suppose this is just part of...
Subject?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
What are you doing here?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Are you okay?
Who was that French guy, anyway.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Can I use some?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Really? A girlfriend then?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
Who the hell are you?
I understand.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
This is it?
Go ahead!
What?  What?
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
He's a twit!
Not again...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
And note the sucked in gut.
He's a miserable twit!
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Yes but, we were wondering-
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
What?  Up?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
Covalent... Right. So...
No, I'll kill you. .
It's suicide.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
I am SO SICK of being right.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
It's... I don't know.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
Hi everybody.
More to the left... Stay parallel...
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Are they behind us?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
never doubted you for a second.
That's it, It's go time.
I heard it too.
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Wait. What did you say?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Weapons storage...
Commander...
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Hold course, Laredo!
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
The army needs you.
I hope I never have to believe that.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
How old are you, Captain?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
I'm so inclined.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
Yessir.
Sir, I think no such thing.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Oh, come now...
Colonel Reed...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
And how rusty are these muskets?
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Not today.
What the hell are we doing?
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Then why are you teaching me...?
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
I guess still in the locker.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
What about him?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Trade for what?
You gave him the money?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
You know how to write one of these?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
You positive about that?
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Or else what?
You say look at you?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
You have a card in here?
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
I'm looking at you.
That's what I'm doing.
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
You pack a gun?
Ever shot anybody.
Really? You ever been arrested?
She looks familiar.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
What do you get out of this?
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
I had to tell 'em something.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Really.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
You mean like we don't give a shit.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
It's all mine.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
You saw that one?
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
I don't know.
What took you so long?
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
He already knew it.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
What a spectacular view.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
How about now?
What? You sure?
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
What's so great about Sweden?
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Maureen.
Roger.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Smokes?
Try Wednesday.
Did you?
Get up.
If you get it back in one piece.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
How long, then?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Don't fall asleep.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Stay away. Or else.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
What guy?
You sure it wasn't me?
The ah... the radio's out.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
You killed them.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
I don't know.
Ho-ly shit.
Say what?
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Yup.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
Hmm.
That guy rules!
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Forget it.
Are you the one who left that note?
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
Did you sign up yet?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
There's my dad with Joanie.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
What's he doing now?
He's insane!
This is way too creepy.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Not really...
I didn't get it either.
Give me all your money, bitch!
You won't believe it! Guess!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
That guy is totally amazing.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're just jealous.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Just some people from work...
When was this?
Hello?
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
May I ask what you're doing?
How much is this?
You still interested in that?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
That's five hundred dollars.
Five hundred.
Is this one any good?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Really? Can I see it?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
So is that your boyfriend?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
So, why did you bring this along?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Yes, that would certainly do...
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
It's not hopeless...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
What, like a girdle?
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Well when can we do something?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
Just someone so young...
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
What do you want?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I don't know.
I have no idea - I just want to...
Thank you, doctor.
Seymour?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
What?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
Don't much like them.
Anything special about them?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I don't suppose I could watch.
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
What a good week.
We need to talk.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
How many do you think they've killed?
Why do the workers look unhappy?
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
He has children?
Afraid of lions.
How many cattle?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Occasionally
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
No, you didn't, Frank.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I'll do it.
So this is what you do, huh?
You're really good, you know.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Or we could do that.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Can I help you?
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
You've got to do something!
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Can I have some of your water?
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
Egon!
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
What's that?
I'm Ray --
And now you're going to eat it?
What kind of tests?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Ready?
Now that's one ugly dude.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Is that your professional opinion?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Uh-huh.
You're quite a housekeeper.
Damn!
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
Don't scream.
Great rehearsal.
You're the best one in your row.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Did you see anything?
Something was definitely here.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
All right.  I'll try.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Who?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
What happened??!!!?
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
What is it?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
For what purpose?
How was your date?
So do I.
Ray -- Something's here.
How do you know?
Boy, that was a rough one.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Me, too.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
That's what you told me two days ago!
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Where have you been?
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
I want that bastard dead!
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Then you'd be out of a job.
Where is my family?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Give away food?
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The Senate too?
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Narcissus!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Before they leave, get gold.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you always drive like this?
Aren't you eating?
Why not?
Could you do it?
I think I'd better go home now please.
Where is the car?
Is anything wrong?
Where we going?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
With a family?
Okay.
Don't cry. 
But you're not enrolled.
-- really incredible --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
The marble?
Benjamin?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Ben.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Exactly how do you mean?
What's that?
You're not one of those agitators?
What for?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
BENJAMIN?
I'm putting it on the top step.
I'm putting it here by the door.
Hello.
Where are you?
Yes sir?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
In general.
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
No.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
What are you so scared of?
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Yes, I do.
Hello, Benjamin.
He didn't see me.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?
Yes.
Why don't you get it.
Well.
Yes?
Will you bring me a hanger?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
You can admit that, can't you?
On your first time --
That you're afraid --
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
How do you get out of the house?
What do you say to him?
Always?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
And you were a student also.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Well how did it happen?
Do you understand that?
I have my reasons.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
This is absurd.
I don't believe you.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Well --
I guess -- about my future.
Have you thought about graduate school?
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Thank you very much, sir.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
No, I don't.
What's happening?
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
Have you a minute now?
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
I don't like your tone.
I've quit.
Never?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
What?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Going?
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Strange man...
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Really?
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
I'll not denounce you.
Do you understand?
Grusinskaya --
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Very early in the morning.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
If we could scare up some men to play.
That was my last.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Is that for me?
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Any letters?
Oh!
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Oh, I've got to find it.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
You're trembling.
Really?
Please -- please!
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Do you like me better?
Moreover --
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Yes.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
You're sweet.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
What?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
You're discharged.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
How is the house?
No. No word.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
No.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
What? Me?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Oh, come on, Roy.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
What happened to your hand?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Sure.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
You want a drink?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
There's nothing more to talk about.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Let me see how you did that one.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Roy?
Roy? It this all we have?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What?
He retired.
Upstate.
Take a hike, you mean?
Think about it. Okay?
What?  What for?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
What's that?
I realize this is a shock.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Oh, Jesus.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
Carter.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Do you know who did this?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
It's an option.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Where are you going?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I'm not leaving without her.
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
What are you doing here?!
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Still wants to move out?
This kid just wants his freedom.
The serial killer?
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
What's this?
Thanks!
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
What if your parents come home?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
No, Mom -- keep it on!
What is it this time?
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
What should I do?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Halloween.
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
What is that?
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
You've created a monster.
No!!!
Home, sweet home.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
No.
Um.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
At least we found the diamonds.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
You know what gets me?
Can I have the Cadillac?
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
I've been looking at motorcycles.
You ever own a motorcycle?
What's funny about that?
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Hi, Penelope.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
I know you think that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Is Penelope in?
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Fifty years?
For Africa.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
College!
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Oh hell.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
What's this?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
I'm engaged.
How do you do?
What's the matter?
Like hugging a lamp post.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Now that's what I call fun.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
I have some change!
Breakfast?
Which one?
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
It couldn't!
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Go on.
And what is his most cherished possession?
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
A dozen?
He cried.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
No you don't.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
I feel the same way.  What next?
What brought you back?
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You're a son of a bitch.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
I'm an honorable clown?
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
What is this thing that kills me?
No.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
I dunno, boy.
What happened?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
Not true.
I don't really know.
Yes, he is.
What are his symptoms?
Really?
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
He'd assume we had.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I'm touched.
Coming.
What then?
Is he coming home?
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You and Harold are friends?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
They didn't murder me.
Do it!
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Kid--kid--
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
No.
I just want to ask some questions.
You're still dressed?
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I'm getting angry.
The other girl is the star?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Where's he?
No.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Say what?
They were here?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
More or less.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
She left you right?
Granville?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Hello?
Mast?
The police? They know less than you do.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
But this is my apartment.
Do the police want to arrest me?
What happened?
Jake?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Take it or leave it.
Where's Ratan?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
I thought you were a businessman.
What's that?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
The guy who bought you that ring.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
Was he with a girl?
And what are you studying?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Took it?
Your tree.
Okay, lady. Out.
But there is a family resemblance.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Because if you are...
And what do you do, my dear?
A block of ice.
Eh, no.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you dance?
Yearse!
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
All right.
No. 
You look as if you could.
That's a nice teapot.
Why do you say that?
Oh, my. We're too late.
We'll come back in the morning.
No.
He's stopped.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I like Glaucus.
You are the wisest person I know.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
No. I'd feel stupid.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you advance on me.
That wasn't very scary.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Look at the stars.
- end where I began.
Yes.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
You liked your teachers?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Yes... Yes. You look...
It's a beautiful dress...
It's coming.
I want to go back!
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
No bad dreams.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
And you're sure it was a woman?
Well... G'bye.
Wait!
Steve...
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Who?
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
hound of resurrection --
The freak in the gas mask --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Who's the squirt?
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
Yup.
You're kidding --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
You better have that looked at.
Out? Out out?
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Hi.
It's freezing, isn't it?
Hit me.
Yes, I --
Christ!
You fucking ass-holes.
What's happening?
Will you sign for the bed?
Oh.
No time for argument.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Please listen to me --
Oh my God.
Bastard.
Well?
Don't look at me.
Help me.
What happened to you?
Back from where?
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
You can't love him.
Kirsty.
Kirsty? It's very late.
No, damn you --
Just a thought --
How long since you were here?
Well?
What have you done?
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Julia?
Maybe a brandy.
Is this upsetting you?
-- I'll go see.
Huh?
What's wrong with you?
What are you drinking?
This isn't the bedroom.
What's going on?
I'll get the doctor.
What a pretty tune.
You'd like the house.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Are you O.K.?
I guess.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Oh no?
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
What?
I'll come back later, huh?
Alison's.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
What are you doing?
Don't you want to hear what's next?
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Yeah.
What are you snickering about?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
My band.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
What's up?
The little skate-fuckers.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Sonic Death Monkey.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Well what about the new Echo --
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
That's what I said.
Who are you going to see?
Anna Moss.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Great.
Are you all right?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Let's not.
Rob --!
Can I do anything?
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
I dunno.
Hi.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
What?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Of course it is.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Hi.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Sure they are.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I guess I am.
Are you alright?
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Do you want me to be there?
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
You're soaking.
What do you want to do?
When are you going back?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
C'mon.  I want to know.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
Hi.
Just local, of course.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  Probably not.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
About what?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Hi, Marie.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
You haven't even seen it!
Are you okay?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I knew this was going to happen.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
But you must have --
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
I think you have more.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
-Okay okay.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
I have friends.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're wrong.
What's all that?
You want me to front for you.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I hope I never get that old.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Don't.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Good way to lose your job.
-Et lux perpetua-
Stop.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
You feel you know me.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Why?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Who am I deceiving?
Not so scared.
Finish your prayers?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Your name?
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Equals?
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Where!
The last four.
How are you?
And have you something to settle with me?
He found us even there.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
What's the point?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
The resemblance is amazing.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
But --
The five hundred? Sure.
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Mr. Burns --
Just for the first year.
Anything the matter?
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
How long is what?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
What do you mean by that?
You've had a better offer, eh?
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Bermuda.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Then what does he want with you?
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Hildy!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Look at me, Hildy --
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Ring that number, will you?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Don't open that!
No!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
When did you deliver this first?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Where'd you wire him?
Sure.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Hildy, darling!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Anything you want, Boss.
Who do you want?
Sure, boss.
Walter!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
I call. What you got?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Hold the phone!
We know what you're up to.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Just a minute, Johnson!
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
What went off?
Where is he?
Just one second --
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
A sight for sore eyes!
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
I won't.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Who is it?
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Where's the money?
Mother!
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What's the idea?
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
Why not?
For heaven's sake, why not?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Get the cops, somebody.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I know a secret.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
I did see them. I did.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
But Dad, It's the News.
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
How's your war, Mac?
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
Here's to music. And absent friends.
You joined up.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
I agree.
Ma, Tiny's in.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
He left!
Thank you.
Hey, great they're back.
What?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
What the hell are you laughing about?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
No, really.
The Duke?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
She's pretty cute.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Really fucking awesome.
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Go around him.
Fine. I'll go straight.
Check this out.
What are you doing!
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So.
So what?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
How long has it been?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
I'll go. It's my fault.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Grampa... watch the language.
What should I do?
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Hey.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Mr. Willis?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Over.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
And?
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Oui.
Shall we close up, then?
I am sleepy.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Fine.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I've moved on.
That's not how he tells it.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
You still in the market for a real boy?
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Be still my crotch.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
Boy, this is good!
I'm sorry about my parents.
Shaving cream?
Oh, and the sun block?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I don't know. Something.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Who is it?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Bravo to you, Puff!
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Ugnh.
Unn.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Give me a bottle of beer.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I'm ready.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
Are you ready for another?
Do you really think you can beat him?
Make it twenty.
Only when I work.
Character.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Here, I got it.
So does Eddie.
Well, we won't.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Please don't get off me now.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Who's he?
You name it, we shoot it.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Whaddya mean?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
How do you feel?
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Is this all we got left?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Try me.
You better not miss, friend.
How long you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
What do you do on the other days?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Why did you do that?
What time is it?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
You got it all in your head?
Give it back to me.
What happened?
No. You?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
A week? A year?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
How much do you remember?
Do you remember where it is?
Humans.
That's who you are too, Emma.
You want me to stay?
Do you still want me to stay?
You and that damned garden.
I surrender --
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Need some gas?
Why, Dad?
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
It was so real, Dad.
They'll get us.
What is it?
Don't go in.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What do you want me to do?
Just my luck, no ice.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Are you all right?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Spunky. He told you about that?
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
What're you talking about?
Not really...
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Pops!
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Dad, please...
Thanks, Pops.
Nice meeting you.
We're loose!
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And our forces?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Where's it headed?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
You're late.
I shouldn't have left her.
Stop it.
I don't need it.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
They let you out?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
Why did you people come here?
What do you want us to do?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Marcus!  I did it!
Your treat.
Ah, Venice...
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
Bingo.
The Ark of the Covenant.
My room!
How did you get here?
All I have to do is squeeze.
It's important!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Well, what was left of him.
Rats?
What?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
What did you get?
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Nice landing.
It's a new experience for me.
Now, who are all these people?
The penitent man is humble before God.
I like Indiana.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
What?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
What's that?
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
That's far enough!
You will go to palace there.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
What'd he say?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Took what?
And then they took their children.
What'd he say now?
What?!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
What about the future?
He's afraid of something.
WILLIE?!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I want to go home...
What're we going to do?!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
I know...it sounds insane.
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
You'll be alive.
What do I do?
I don't know...To get Al.
Yeah...Who is?
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Corridor A.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
What is it?
She doesn't seem to understand.
What happened?
Where are you going?
What did that cost?
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Which one?
Just don't show fear.
Voice stress analyzer.
What is it, your charm?
Osaka.
Sapporo..
Where are you going?
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
One of your instincts?
Don't touch a thing.
What next!
Ow!
He was with Gruner!
He aready made the deal..
Awwww...
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
You just got a Mickey.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Can you fly this?
You didn't tell us you were coming?
PEM115!
What are you doing here, where've you been?
It may have been affected.
Right.
Well...
Take the card.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
Ahhh...nothing.
The fresh tuna?..
Is someone else here?
I'll be right there.
Dinner...tonight.
Let you leave without it.
What way?
Promise you what?
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why?
What did you tell them?
You work for Ryuji?
Were you working for him last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
Then why are you smiling like that?
What's Gruner like?
And Dieter.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Why not?
Are you alright?
What did you tell them?
How?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Kiss her you fool.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
It wasn't me. It was him.
He wants to apologise.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
You can't take that.
It will be fine. You have another.
Ow?...
It will.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
What's new?
I'll take some.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
P.J.'s.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Alright, alright.
Sure.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
What are you cooking?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
You're exaggerating!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
So, what are you going to do?
You're taking "no" for an answer?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Come again?
Hey, Lowell.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Why?
I can take her.
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
Will independent sources corroborate that?
What are you and Mike going to do?
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Yeah...
Oh, my God.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Lowell!
Yeah, that's right.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Give me a break!
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
...but that's as far as I go...
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Should I just take the documents now?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
You believe that?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
You attract a crowd.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
I told the truth!
That's not the point.
You manipulated me into this...!
You greased the rails!
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
What's happening?!
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What do you mean there is no family?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
"I would bet on it."
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Baby. You are so HOT!
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
It was a gift from a client.
He's the wrong man.
Is she Asian?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
My God.
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
No.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
He'll regret this.
Oh, for the love of...
Marylin? When did I say...?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She never particularly cared for me.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
I want to be your -- your wife.
No.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Honey, I could sit...
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Hello Marylin.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Income tax evasion?
Rex. Get away from the door.
We are. And it's winding down.
Who's that?
Lilly's up.
Every week --
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
What?
So what?
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Mr. Massey --
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
What?!
That's delusional.
...arty farty!
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Where does that leave us?
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
What ten thousand?
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
South America!
What've you got against King Westley?
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Who is he?
Ridiculous!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
Peter Warne! 
Oh, no—no.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
It's my daughter! Go after her.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
You talk as if—
What would you like to have me do?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Oh, yeah?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
What happened?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Who are you?
Here—
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Nope. No complaints.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
Here. Eat your head off.
Sure.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What're you going to do?
That's swell!
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
I hope you got your money.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
What's up?
Collect?
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
I'd put you there myself.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Funny couple, ain't they?
A trumpet?
You send telegrams here?
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
See that. They're gone!
Yeah.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
What do you think, Lou?
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
You know you keep saying that.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
What's it look like, Nick?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...Oswald?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
That's our case!
Four to six.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
Aren't you being a little hard?
I'm not sure I understand.
No.  Never heard of him.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
They killed him, honey.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
What's wrong, Lou?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Are they?  Why would they?
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Well, thanks for coming.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
It never did. 
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
What are they?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
How'd you know where he was?
What's she willing to give us?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
Help yourself.
My pocketbook.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I'd love one, but not there.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
What did they want to know?
He's the one who wants you.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
This is pretty.
How old's Annette?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I called you last night.
You know some interesting people.
He tries to act cool.
You're avoiding the question.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
You do that?
The feds. It's evidence.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
It'll be more than that.
What if he checks it?
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
How'd you find out?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
What if I plead guilty?
If I don't cooperate?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Yes'm.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
How can you help us?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
You said that the last time.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
I thought I did.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
Sure.
He said he didn't know about it.
You think I'm kidding?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
For what?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
What the hell you doin'?
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
I just came here to talk.
Yeah.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
No, I give it to someone else first.
Can you cover that?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Who's paging you?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
So where did you go?
With Ordell?
Were you a disco guy?
C'mon, don't lie.
Did you ever go I one?
About five years ago.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
As low as two.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
I'm going to wait in the car.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Who was that?
What did he do?
How much is there?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
So what, you left her there.
You couldn't just hit her?
So you're sure she's dead.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Came outta where?
Then what?
What'd you shoot her with?
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Jesus Christ.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Beaumont Livingston.
House or apartment?
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
I can see that. Why?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
What's up with this shit.
I'm alone.
That's all?
How'd you find me?
Well, give it to me then.
All I did was walk out with it.
In a way, yes.
My office.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Are you all right?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Grass never did that to me.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Hello.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Wait ... Daddy.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I am.
I'm too messed up to teach.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Not me, buddy.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She hates me, Louis.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I can't relax.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
That help?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Who? Jed?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Yeah, but for what?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Why? What for?
What does it say?
What the hell are you doin'?
I can't do it.
While you were in the shower.
I want to know. You tell me!
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Where have they gone?
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
You look upset.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Oh God!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
Where's Wong?
How was Palm Springs?
Lennox Hospital.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
I just need to talk.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Everywhere, like a plague.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Do you want me to get someone?
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Goodbye old friend.
What are you doing?!!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Bomb?
Sergeant!
Uh-oh.
Better let me.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Where is...?
Then what do we do?!
Earth II.
Jesus what the hell is that?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Kicker, anything?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Rizzo, he's out there.
What if you miss?
Hey.
That's why I'm here.
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
I couldn't save them.
Rizzo, pull away!
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Kaboom.
I...I don't know what I did...
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
What do we do?!!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
I didn't say I was good at it.
It's just you and me, then.
Kicker!
Something's wrong.
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Azrael can you repeat that?
What have you done?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Can we get through these?
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
What's that one, there?
He's comin' up -- !
Love ya.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
She's right.
Got a pen on you?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
...Nothing.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Where'd you get all this?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
What happened?
You all right?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
We're not even sure what it was.
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Leg of lamb this time?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
You love sharks?
What have you got there, Lenny?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You know how I feel about her.
So, what do you think we should do?
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Is that normal?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
I don't like Katrina.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
I still have your virginity!
Wait, let me take that.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
I try really hard, actually...
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Cool.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Hi Dad.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Or...
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Touche.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
No way! She's pretty.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Juno, what's the matter?
What?
No.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
You dropped this.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
Hold still.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Carryin' a gun.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
What if they're dangerous?
...thank you.
...I don't know.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Henry Lucas.
That bad?
Now why is that?
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
So how's it going?
I like that.
Up yours.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
All set?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Carrie, watch for Early.
What about you?
Any word from that gallery?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
You were plenty hot.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
With how many people?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
She can fuck?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Oh man, that's the best.
You know what else?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Probably.
It's no big deal, right?
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
I hate this game.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
How much you gonna take?
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Casper, where is he?
Where you goin' tonight?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Sup then? Sup?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
I'm nervous.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Who are they?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Telly is at Steven's?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Hello.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
The pain. The fucking pain!
You are being ripped open.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Do you know where he went?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Yep.
Oh shit.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
Hello?
You want a wip-it?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
What man? What is it?
We seem to have a little problem here?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
Are you crazy?
The message!  I figured out--
What are you talking about?
No shit!
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
Hello, Peter.
To get your attention.
And -- what path is that?
Why not?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
I'm just trying to play the game.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
Let me speak to my daughter.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
No problem.  We're in.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Do you like my dad?
Congratulations, dad.
Who told you that?
How long has she been dead?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
What do you think he did?
I'm busy right now.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
As large as castles.
He's right, Kathy.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
It's a good play, but risky.
About what?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Feel like practicing?
Bainbridge Books.
Are you one of the players?
That's a very personal question.
Well, I think I've had enough.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
Do you?
I'm just curious.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
You.
Did you call?
I tried again and got through.
Nothing.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Peter...
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
I'm not nervous.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
The new Queen lives.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
I can't reach her.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
Can she be forced?
She must make a glaive.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Even by you?
You too are lonely.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
My <u>friend</u>.
Fame.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
I'm not hungry.
Well, I'm not impressed.
You've eaten nothing.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
What is that awful looking place?
A venison pie as big as a house.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
You do?
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
We meant only to please you.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Put me down, you lout!
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
And do you think I live on air?
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
He is the King.
You were attacked in the forest?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Modred! Impossible!
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
Yes.
Few have survived it.
But you would not stay with me.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
It will not help.
What's that man's name?
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
...Good...  But what's special in him?
130... 140...
Rocket launcher.
The yellow and pink.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Come on, get down!
Mathilda? May I come in?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Where are you going?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Risky business, isn't it?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
May I ask you a personal question?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
You can't sit here like that.
But... He works for your same employer?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
...Who sent you?
Is he still alive?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
He probably just went somewhere.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
I don't accept that.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Nothing's going to happen.
Are you two planning kids?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
What would you like us to do?
How long does this... Mania last?
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
I've seen it before.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
I do love you... very, very much.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Your father?
To where?
Why?
Red flags man.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
It has to be a full character's name.
When are you leaving?
Phileas Fogg?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
I missed you Kris.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
In a hospital.
What do your friends call you?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
Where did he go?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Sarah -- with an H?
I sometimes fade out.
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
Yes.
You OK?
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Ben?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Why?
I'm going to fill it right now.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Your color.
I don't understand any of that.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
What did they look like?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Harvard Law School?
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Why would I kill my husband?
I loved him!
Were you with another man?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
It's so shameful...
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
No.
Did you hear a shot fired?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Come again?
What are you talking about?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
You're hitting on me?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Yes?
-- his life?
After you went to all that trouble?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
You ready?
How'd it go at the trial?
Uh -- family.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Too demure?
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Aside from that.
And you know this for a fact?
The what?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
How could this happen?
Yes? Ms. Woods?
Amazing how?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
You're beautiful.
And I fully support that.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Pink ones.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Why so few?
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
You go?  Not watch fun?
We come watch... we come watch...
Fire moat... why do that?
Birdies... pretty...
We watch... good fun...
More fun win battle?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You're magnificent.
God protect me.
And you... are you not also afraid?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Enough!
You be our guest, Jack.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
But... but, why?
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
Pregnant, is she?
Damn them!
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Fine-looking army.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Beware.
This is ogre's magic.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
God's blessing.
Is she... dead?
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Water doesn't burn...
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
One more turn...
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
You see!  You see!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
These for me?
I detest serpents.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Jack!
He'll not flee if I show myself?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Who?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Its powers are strong.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
No!  I won't let it happen...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Step lively now!
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I'd be honored.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Sorry, Jack.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Uhm... fine work.
Lost?
In a dream.
Dad's disappeared!
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
And video games after!
When does George get to come see his house?
Oh.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
I couldn't get it to go down.
What are you doing up so early?
Alyssa.
You're a good girl.
My mother would die.
I wanted him to marry her.
I'm coming in.
Josh said...
You'd hate him for the trick.
He won't leave my room.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I hate to ask about a window.
Pardon me?
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Did you got through my pants?
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I would have killed him.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
You look better than ever.
She seemed upset.
I still don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
Can you build a house in four months?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
How many bedrooms will your house have?
You should lock your doors.
I need to talk to you.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
It makes me sad.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
What is it?
Finished or unfinished?
Oh...with his ear infection!
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
It's been a while.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
You've never said that before.
I'm married.
I better get the kids home.
I wasn't sure.
We've eaten.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
To shave your chest?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
I brought a few of my own.
A night in the hole?
I'm talking about a haircut.
These are free papers.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Want me to come back some other time?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
I got it... boss.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
That's right, a loan officer.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
What are you talking about?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
This fork is filthy.
You know what I'm saying.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
What'd you say?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
Crawfords.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
What?!
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Don't make me take them away from you.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
I can't eat this.
I know you're not talking to me...
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
What is that?
You got your own nightclub?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
They gave me life, mama.
Wait for the firemen!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
What's going on here?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
ADRIAN!
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Try an angel.
How come you're not older?
What is it?
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Makin' friends already.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
You're a good devil, Dad.
This is bad, Nicky.
Bus?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
You think I'm a tourist?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Hey.
Valerie?
No.
Yes...
..."The Devil?"...
We're going to Jersey?
Don't do it.
Nicky!
It looks like the work of a brother...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
That's better.  How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
Who invited you?
That was a great shot you made.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
What's going on, Logan?!
Why did you do that??!!
Why aren't you in Nursery?
What's wrong, Available?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
You prefer women?
Sad? What made you sad?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
And now?
About what?
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
You could have called me yourself.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Of course.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Why show me?
Why tell me?
Where did you get that?
Are you here to help me?
I'd rather be with you.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Uh-uh.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
How do we know this is the right way?
I'm afraid.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
And Sanctuary?
Is it inside the city?
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
Come with us.
Hello, Sandman.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
How long have you been living here?
What kind of place is this?
How did you get here?
Are there any other humans?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
I'm sorry.
Can you make it back?
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Good... You up for a drive?
You okay, man?
You're a musician?
Very strange.
No.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
What's that, Ed?
I was here yesterday.
Pete?
Have you partied with him?
How'd it happen, Alice?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
You all right?
Andy, who is that guy?
I don't. I don't know him.
What night is that?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
What's the matter?
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
I won't ever tailgate.
Something wrong?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
What's bothering you, Madison?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Where's Alice?
Good book, huh?
Where would you feel safe?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
I thought there might be somebody inside.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
At sixty?
Okay.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
No. No, I don't.
I missed you.
No... I told you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Where'd you come from?
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
A what?
Sorry.
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Certainly not.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
They were in a quandary, and—
Charming chap.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Huh?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Cave, eh? Where?
You mean you don't want to go?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
And mine's Conway.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Very often.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Sondra Bizet.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
What is it? Has he fainted?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
George, come back!
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
I'd go mad!
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
You can't take her away from here!
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
Where were you hiding?
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Good.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Ouch!
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
What is it?
Why, he's speaking English.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
EXCUSE ME–
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
No. just peace on Earth.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
I wasn't scared...
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Now what?
What's going on, Kay?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Sure.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
Yeah ... ?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Goodwill...
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Which way?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Take it.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
And replace them with new ones.
Why?
You set your patients on fire!
Victim's a white female.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Hence the expression...
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Lara called me.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You can't run --
John --
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We can't grab it...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Go ahead.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Confirm with trig and image.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
To them.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
She was looking right at me.
Wally, listen to me...
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Rufus, play it back...
It's a little late for that.
You're alive?
I forgive you.
Who are you?
Do you know who I am?
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
You're not gonna kill me?
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
What about the picture --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Something wrong?
What?
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
-- and then walk out.
This is all my fault.
It's insanity around here.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
What kind of cop were you before this?
No.
It was nobody's fault.
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
I can take you down there.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
So, wait, you're from where?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
I know.
What the fuck was that about?
Ricky's not wearing one.
No.
Uncle Bobby?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
You talk to Max today?
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
I want you to quit.
Max offered to stake me.
But what about them?
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
So what do we do?
Where's Ricky?
This is it.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Nah.
Where is the Soho Grand?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
I'm on the phone.
So, it's not a winning record.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
How am I being shitty?
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
Fuck them.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
We need guns.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
I like it.
Nice work.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
How much is it?
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Oh really. Why's that?
So they said more than the address.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Motherfucker...
You know this guy?
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
So is this the drop?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
What are you doing.
The penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Wanna bet?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Calm down.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
No. I'll wait here.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
I want to leave right now.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Stop.
Ow, shit...
And where is...?
No shit?
No, really, mate?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Come, now. You just got here.
Ricky.
Yeah.
You know my pager number?
Keys.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
I'm working trains. Selling.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
How's it feel?
Daddy, where's my money?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
What did you give it to me for then?
You ain't lying.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I will do it.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
Do you?
What points?
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Just an idle question.
I'm in Detroit.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
Did you hear what I said?
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
We need you too!
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Dear heart, where are you?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
If you want to tell me.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Did you see the papers today?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
"His greatest greatness."
She know?
Is she hooking?
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Head nigger in charge?
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
What am I doing here?
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
[Who's the boss?]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
What is it?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
You did something on impulse?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
You mean a misfire?
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
No.
No.
Potential? I don't understand.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Not at all?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Why do you ask?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Then be trained.
Be a swimmer.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
I don't believe you.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
Bye, Mom.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
He's not a cop killer.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
I'll call her up.
Waddaya gonna do now?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Who told you that?
Hey! What are you doing here?
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Who?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Marty.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
You come up here often?
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
No...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
What?
I'm just here with another girl.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Sure. This girl said...
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
I said, is she Italian girl?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I don't like her.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Well...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yes, O'Reilly?
What are you going to do with him?
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore –  House. You in the market Duke?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Black capsule.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Is he out?
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
He only lasted one season.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You're an attractive man.
But I'm married.
Very happily married.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
They missed the boat.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
No, never in the slightest.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
About that chest-cutter...
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
Sir?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Against anything. Just protest.
Hello, John.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Can I help you pack?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh!
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The letter from John Doe.
Say that again.
You made it up.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
I can read. I can read!
All right, boys, here he is.
Well, maybe you're right.
Duets? But can we trust him?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Colonel!
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Had any schooling?
Where'd you play?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Help yourself.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
A what?
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Four bits.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I don't get it.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Yes! I was paid! But the—
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Flowers.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
No -- you can't do that.
Not that we know of.
What's the line?
What happened? Is there a problem?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
I won't get away with it.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Who are you again?
Hi, Roper.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
What's the point of this?
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
Recruited you from where?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
We see each other every couple of months.
Tell me what you need.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
You tell me.
Yes.
What did you see?
I'm just practicing my lying.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's got the girl.
That's a chance I gotta take.
McCall, you all right?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Please. I'm begging you.
Maybe you should be.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
You like this place?
There is?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie?
You crazy? With all those people around?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I can't do that.
Why?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
It's time to wake up.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
You are not a God.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Where the hell are you going?
You sure he's going to come?
The maze has been changed --
Where you plugged-in from?
What?
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Two maze runners.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
What did he tell you?
Not his style.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
An interface attendant.
You said we were on the same programming team.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Why?
I wasn't with you.
But you were with me.
Don't know what you're talking about.
What's so funny?
It was just there.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Voice activate.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
We've got him locked!
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
So how can we get to it?
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Release the power with the power.
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
SKULL!!
It's... an eagle?
... A falcon?
Just shut your gap!
GET OFF ME!
THREE SECONDS!!
You own a hotel, sir?
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Are you frightened?
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Shane was a friend of yours?
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
Bastard didn't even show.
Inside, they were talking of you.
What's the matter?
Something came up.
Same here.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
So you all make the same mistakes?
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
Charlie!
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
Meyer just finished the books.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
How soon can we pull this off?
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
What are ya thinkin'?
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Not stupid. Fat.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
The terms will be mine.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Maranzano wants you dead.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
What a cozy little scene.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Special occasion?
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
What's the maximum safe dose?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back? You're sending me back?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Holy shit.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I might wake up.
Stu?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
He's an organic farmer.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Where to?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
It was?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Why do I always laugh at that?
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
How about getting married?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
The war's on!
Dinner, Hubert.
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
He's batty!
One minute! Just one minute!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Yes. Come in.
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Washington!
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Mr. President!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Thank you, sir.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Yes, I was--
Ah, now, that's better.
It does!
Mr. President--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
What's your name?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Pardon?
I know. It's--Violet.
Abigail.
I've got more. You better tell me.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
What you *have* to do is fight!
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
No?
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
What do you want, Senator?
Why don't you do it yourself?
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
That's him. Let him in.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
His first 'whiff'!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Most every day.
He sure is pixilated.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
But they did take place?
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Feel better now?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Have you seen the papers?
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Now, what do you see?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
What did you mean by that?
I've often thought about going back.
Mary, I'm going home.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Look, I can do it!
With pay!
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
How'd you get the picture?
Sure.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Yes, but you said—
Fourteen carat?
Stuff, sir?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
You can't come up here!
Nuisance value?
He's what?
It's a lie!
Newspaperman?
Yes?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Have a drink?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Now, where were we?
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Mrs. Semple?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Well, I don't know. I—
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Look, he's temperamental.
Your Honor—
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Proceed.
Brookfield just came in.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
Farmer?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Me, sir?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
What an asshole!
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
I see.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
What?
No?
What's that?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You do?
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
It was Henry Follett.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
But you know how to drive?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Can you help Mom?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Finally, some common sense...
What?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
I'm not making any promises.
We don't discuss it.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Is that when you split up?
And he's where?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
And this is legitimate therapy?
Which thing?
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Is it something you've heard about me?
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Transference!
Sofie...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
You got off easy.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you talking about?
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
This is great!
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
How's it coming?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Did you carry a gun?
But look at me now...
At least you pulled yourself out...
How'd you do it?  The new you.
And a birth certificate is enough?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
And what ritual would that be?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
My very good friend! What a surprise.
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
C'mon, friend.
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Where are they taking him?
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
For what?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Jonathan?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Do you really think he'll show up?
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
You did not!?... We're not!?
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd know.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Where are you going?
Do I?
Come on, baby!
Who are you?
How about... the Savage Six?
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Yes!
How's your dad?
He'll never make it.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Hi.
What?
Stay away!
I admire you.
What's your real name?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
You're the Sphinx.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Oh don't start that again --
So what else has Superman got?
Or flowers.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Agents?
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Sounds good.
Maybe there was traffic.
Are you famous?
So what can I get you?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
She likes you.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Don't crunch the leaves.
And there's the Sphinx.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
Oh no.
We've got lift off!
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Proceed.
Ah -- you approve?
I'm glad you like it.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
There are none here.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
I don't know, sire.
Who is there?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Bastia -- and you?
Why are you carrying the dog?
My God...!  What time is it?
When did it start?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Thank you, Napoleon.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
What's your name?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
When is she supposed to return?
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Were you in love with him?
And now?
Yes -- what is it?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
But you will not... be safe...
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I believe you sent for me.
Why did you give it to him?
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What the hell is the matter with you?
What?
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
What was there to tell?
Can you give me a drink, please?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
And, where did you see my portrait?
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
What did you say his name was?
Come in.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Well, let me in.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Y'all never use it?
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Fuck, what's his name?
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Who is that?
Who is that?
So.
$247.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
You see that?
Yeah, air.
You make it sound so easy.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
You did all this for me?
Can I help you?
What's the matter?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
You coming in?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
You too.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
That the big one, huh?
Today ain't my day.
I do.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Rancho Cucamonga?
You too big.
Hey, how you get out of here.
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Mr. Nasty time?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Don't remind me.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Amtrack?
I need your help.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
Yes, yes, I understand.
You're out of your mind.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
What would you do in my place?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
Ready?
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Oh, Jesus ...
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Irene is going to help.
You're going to go see her.
What am I supposed to say to her?
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Hey!
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
You stole that.
That's pretty good.
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
It's under control.
Yeah.
Put her on.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Is he hit pretty bad?
What can we do, Mother?
Twenty-five wives!
He lied!
Pearl dotes on him.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
I tried to save her.
Hing, hang, hung.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
To see Dad?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
John?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Are we goin' home, John?
Where ye from?
I'll see to Pearl.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What are you doing, boy?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
All right boy: where's the money?
Now: Where?
Nothin'. 
I'll tell you a secret.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Yes; John's bad.
Can I have milk too?
About our secrets.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Mornin', ladies.
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What do you want?
I been bad!
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
How long's this been going on?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
You okay?
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
You believe in anything?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
You used me, daddy!
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Did you sleep?
What?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Give me the key, mother.
And then what happened?
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
What you mean 'all at once'?
You feel better now, right?
What is it, Ninotchka?
Well, a hat...
An evening gown.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
That must be the one!
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Which lawyer?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
I am, Gaston.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Good evening, Your Highness.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
If you want to see us you must come later.
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
Bad news?
Yes, monsieur?
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
What's that?
If there is anything we can do for you...
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
Love to.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
What do we do now?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
Was that talkative?
Glorious, analytical...
I must go.
As a representative of Moscow...
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Just smile.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
On which boat?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Not funny, huh?
You remember this room?
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Did you make any change in this room?
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
No speech.
Are we going to build our little house?
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Radio! What is radio?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
No music.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Did I hear something about jewels?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Unfortunately.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
The future of the common people.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
We could get that.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
Why me?
I like it.  I like the idea.
Pay him.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
Why not?
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
The country's loving it.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
What about England?
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
May I say something, Mr. President?
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
That was civil war.
Their fourth!
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Because they're not Americans.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
We took his system out.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
He was a politician.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
Of them.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Buddy? ...
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Yes.
Tomorrow.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How many a those things you got now?
I am older.
How fresh is this coffee?
That man that shot you died in prison.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Yes.
Well what would you call him.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
What about yours?
Probably must be.
...Now that's aggravating.
Yessir.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
No.
You gave your word?
Not like that. Not like you say.
What'd you give for that thing?
I need to know that.
Big talk.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
What're you doin', baby?
So... for how long do we have to...
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What's that.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Where does he work?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
...Where's the transponder?
How'd you find it?
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
How much?
This. And the gas.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Good. I need everything else.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
...Keep going. Don't stop.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
What about one forty-two.
No, one forty-two.
That's me.
Half.
Then you'll like me.
...But that won't last.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
I don't mean braze.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Could I have that in American?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
...I meant your food.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Bad idea...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Oww, the arm, the arm!
You're lying!
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Well, do something, then, damnit!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Great. Good. Content...
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Lyla's very nice.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Of course.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
I have... did it sound that bad?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What was that?
Sure you don't want any salad?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
What're you doing here, Roy?
Yes.
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
What's the matter here?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
She called you 'George,' George.
You're hurting him!!
You don't sound like you're from here.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
The Five?
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Doctor David Ravell.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Does he know you think he's real?
Rosa...
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Like what?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
That's right.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
It's not here. Let's go.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
What?
That was a really shitty thing to do.
How'd they describe her?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
What doesn't?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
But she wanted more out of life, right?
I see.  May I?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Isn't that the point?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Hmm?
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
Yeah?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Hang on there -
It ain't the law!
...Pete?
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Uh, we uh-
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Suckin' away.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
I counted to three, honey.
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
The preacher said it absolved us.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
It was a powerful air.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
Daddy!
You... in the Navy?
Who's that?
Great ass.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Zack, we've got to go.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
See you in the fleet, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir!
Where are you from, boy?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Vietnam?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
How late?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Sid, there's no baby.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
How did it go with you guys?
Lynette, where's Sid?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
You got a girl?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
What's the matter?
Hi.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
Sid, what happened?
No problem.
He said open it.
What?  What do you want me to do?
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Th --
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
-- posed to mean?
NOT THAT ONE?!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Where did you get this clown?
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
She said she did.
And we're never getting in.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Could the child please stop that?
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
That's highly inappropriate.
Push that button for me, will you?
Watch your mouth.
Cut it back a little bit.
Suit yourself.
No, Edgar Allen.
Too many stairs.
Shoulda got an apartment.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
Fuck him.
Nope.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
What are you doing?
Call Dad!
He'll do something.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
I'm sorry.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Not an option.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Alma I told you to...
No...
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Rodgers... this is no good...
Yes sir, I did.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
We're working on that...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
What's up with you?
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
This cool the heat off you any?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Rose?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Congratulations.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Well?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
I know him well enough?
You got salt last week.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Excuse me?
I know that.
You're surrendering.
What unit?
We did.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Shall we proceed?
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
Very well, let us move on to...
Their names, ranks and posts?
What news?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Did your father teach you humility?
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
How old are you?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
You learned her lessons better than I.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
You were an Englishman then...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
And your principles?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Don't worry.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Reverend.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
How many came back?
That bad?
Seventeen.
Father?
Father, you can't let them take him...
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
It's gorgeous!
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Because you promised.
Ellie? What's wrong?
Yeah, sure.
I'm not tired!
Was it Pascow?
Hey--they actually found the place!
What were you listening to?
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
Going to tell Ellie?
No need to apologize.
What do you mean?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
I'm not climbing that.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Almost there, Louis.
What are those for?
Can I have another one?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Why, then, things should be fine.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
She's finally asleep.
Thank you, Louis.
How does he do that?
No!  You gave your word!
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
I'll watch my back.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
There's ... another exit?
Do you believe him?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Maid or not, it fits you.
The curse drove you to gather this?
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Difficult ... to say.
I know the code.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
If I had known --
Come on!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
A fool's errand.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Dead serious.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
We had time to get to know each other.
Where does it make berth?
Agreed.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Is that so?
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Tortuga?
Shut up, before you lose them all!
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Are you certain this is the right way?
Jack!
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
He's still breathing.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Pollution?
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Then you still love me?
Icarus?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Poppy, please --
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
You were never invited to my house.
Of course, sir.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Yes?
When did you...?
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
Why?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
That was an egg?
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
That's pretty good.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
We've got to get the nanobot.
God, what a fight that was.
Icky!
What in the hell?
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
What do you want?
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Where did you get those letters?
Oh, Mother!
Your place?
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
That's an excellent idea.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Fine. Have a seat.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Right - for the first time this year.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Not on my own beat, no.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Well, when are you quitting?
—Mr. Schuyler .
What play?
Araby?
How do you like your bath, sir?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Yes.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Thanks, thanks.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
My mistake - she's glaring.
To Old Madrid.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Who was that?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
What other girl—?
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I think you'd better go.
I suppose you know why I came—?
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Yes.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Heavens! The man's insane!
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Mary Sue?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Have you got any make up?
And they won't be able to tell?
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Oh, hi ...
Where'd you get this?
No she's not.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Sure is pretty.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Oh.  I can't.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
But it could happen.
Want some bridge mix?
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Are you alright?  What is it?
Do you know that it's illegal?
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
It's not in ME.
What do you mean!?
And where's that?
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Noooooo!
You know him?
Who's that?
Can we do any better?
No way.
What do you mean?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
No. She really liked you.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Keeps going ...
Can I open it?
You're gonna forget about me.
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Yeah ...
McIntire's.
Don't get upset.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Excuse me?
I had nothing to do with that.
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
There's worse places.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Well don't you?
Really?
Aren't you a little early?
What's wrong?
TV repair.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Hello.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
It's not cool?
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hello, this is Back.
Hi. This is Jack.
Really?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
...yeah....well you have me now.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I'm going to work.
Yes.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
They're not open yet?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
There's a piano in the street.
Hi.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
This is funny.
Who is it?
What did he want?
Did you pick it up from the street?
Hi.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Yeah.
No.
I didn't do that.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
And your name?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I'll say whatever I want --
Can we agree that that is that?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
How you doin' Barry?
How's business?
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
I need to talk to you for a second.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I know.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
I don't really remember that.
That's it.
What's the problem?
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's ok. That's alright.
It's not bad, it's ok.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
So...did my brother call you?
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
There I was taxed; it's true.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
I have a proposition.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
-- water! --
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
I saw the longing in your eye --
Go to hell!
NEVER!
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Of course.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
Well?
It was fiction, of course.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
Yes?
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
A kiss for each page.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Doesn't that please you?
Ever met Walter Winchell?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
God, these parties are the worst
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Who are you, sir?
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Then you explain it to me?!
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Why did we not know about this sooner?
I want blood
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
Not for me.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Oh Christ...
Mank-
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
Fuck you--
What?
The title?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Jesus Christ --
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Oh God.
It came.
You're going to destroy it
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
This is an abomination There's no music and--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
Oh God. . .
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
How 'bout a real drink?
You want to do the life of Jesus?
They wanna talk to you.
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
This looks done.
Where you going at this hour?
What's wrong?
You know?
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Who's that?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
How do you know? You know her that good?
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
You want us to wait for you?
See? That's all there was to it.
Except fall down like a normal person.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
How's that?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
What?
I did keep an eye...
What do you mean, "you"?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
Jake...
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Jake --
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Sure, what else is new?
Can't you get the money from your friends?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
I said, let's go.
This is the baby sitter.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Feel a little foolish?
If possible -- both.
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I can't. The police have it by now.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I knew it!
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Thank heaven that's over!
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
What about the rest?
Hello.
Not yet, Jeff.
It is something really important, Jeff?
And your stomach?
What a day I've had!
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
No comment.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
I have the whole weekend off.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
I hate funny exit lines.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Friend of yours?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
No.
You can't protect me.
Hey--I want to ask you something.
What would you do, Dad?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
You sure?
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
I was talking to Jim.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
See?  It stopped.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
You remember me?
Boy!
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Are you really going to meet them?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Jim!
It's me!
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
Here.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Who's that?
I'm sorry.
How!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Wash up and go home.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Okay--
See?
Where's Dawson High School?
Yeah--why--
The kids take me.
You still pretty upset?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I'm getting that way, too.
Why did you do that?
Oh, Jim!
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Do you think your father means that?
That one?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Is this him!?
Searching for a money man...
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Saw me --
Do that again.
No --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
You need a COAT!
Well, I don't know about that --
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
You sold him out.
Nick, please, it's me --
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Gabriel!
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Get your own room, Ashley.
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
What?
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
What'd they call her in college?
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Start singing.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
Get in the CAR!
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
...so where is he?
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
What about the Powwow Safe?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How long ago was your makeover?
You want that for here or to go?
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
You knew there were guns in here!
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Oh.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Just a roach, Zook.
Rudy, don't move --
Jesus, Rudy --
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
That was my king!
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Without having them hit the alarms.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
That I should've picked you up?
You fuckin' wish.
I'll call somebody.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
I don't know, but somebody did.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
What's this?
What?
I can do that.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Wong?
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
What's that?
You gonna put it away?
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Your name's Freddy something.
What're you talkin' about?
Follow you where?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
I'm cool.
What's wrong with it?
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
I got the diamonds.
What?
No shit?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Why!
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
Not these guys.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Who shot who?
This must have been in the family a long time.
Yes, ma'am.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
What's the matter with her?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
He knows his alphabet.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
Where you going?
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
Who's Lednov?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Why?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
What did you come back for?
How's that?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
Yeah, how did you know?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
You got no business snoopin' around --
What is it?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
How do you know who we are?
We got to get movin'.
I said let's go.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Would you like to learn them?
Maybe I could start you out.
You're so nice.
Aren't we stayin'?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
How about California?
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Me, too. 101?
Really? That's amazing.
Help!
Oh my God! We're dead!
Cindy, what's going on?
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Cindy, let me...
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Are you okay?
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Oh, right.
How about these buns?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
I'm Cindy.
Noooo!!!
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Father!
Yo! That jacket is tight.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Are you?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
I got it!
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Professor, I think you should see this.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
I can do it myself.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
You're not wearing a belt.
It's okay. I understand.
Father, are you okay?
Yo son, check this out.
This part removes the sense of humor.
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
Bring her home... I guess.
Here we go again.
Carl's a jerk!
No comment!
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
He goes to college with me!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Chip, your ride is here.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Goodnight, honey.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
You bring me such peace...
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
MOTHERFUCKER!!
What did you just say?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
You know who I am, August?
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
You can't tell.
I don't like this.
You scared?
Let's get out of here.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
She's a pretty good sort.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
You'll be all right?
And you knew he'd be here.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
And the other was Judd?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
Perhaps.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I was a great dancer...
Is it about Jacqueline?
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I'll be out in a minute.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
My therapist said that --
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
And they just answer them?
This is just... so...
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
I guess not.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
So you do fantasize?
Have you fantasized about me?
Why not?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Come on!!
Graham...
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
John?
Yes. I just got busy.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Loud.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
God damn you!!
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
What upsets you about that?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
What are you talking about?
Lose something?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I just thought it might --
No, it's nothing like that.
He just asked me questions.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Apparently.
Yes, I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
So what's my share of the dress?
Thank you.
I get real busy between two and four.
Bye.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
I just want to know why you're here.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
No.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Do you want me to stop calling?
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
No.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Plenty of room for two people.
Student?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
Hi, John.
What tapes?
IBM.
May I ask who's calling?
One moment.
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Hi.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You knew these people?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Another kiss?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
You say something?
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
So who changes?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
He didn't make it.
Yeah? What do I do then?
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
Introduce yourselves.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
We're the experts.
In a way...
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Care to indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
That's us.
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
You shouldn't have said that.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I'm...happy.
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
F for...
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
This could be worse than the old series.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
The fuck was that?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Are you there? Miles?
Two years ago, buddy.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Hi.
Hiya.
Highliner, please.
Anything I'd know?
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
And?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
This is rose, right?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Oh, boy.
Look who's talking. You've been there.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
With Maya.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
I said okay?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Let me use your phone.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
We gotta go back.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Me?
Yep. Quite a day.
What the fuck!
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
You want to join us?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Hi.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Yeah? Like what?
Okay. See you around.
I had class.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
You quit drinking?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Stephanie! Stop!
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Houdini's sick.
No.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
I think it's contaminated.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Graham --
I see.
Explain, act crazy?
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Explain noises.
I cursed.
That roof is over ten feet high.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
It's getting stronger.
Graham.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
We might lose the signal.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
What about Isabelle?
What's that?
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
...Gotta go...
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Goodbye?
You must have known that before you came.
You're not Baxter?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Offend anybody lately?
South of here, past Chimayo.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Daddy?
Who?
Because they don't like what I want.
Who is he?
Get out of here, Jake.
New record.
What are you talking about?
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Why come to me?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
What brings you into my saloon?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What is it you want from me?
Nifty.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
You really are a gambler.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
-- What's wrong with that?
The public decides who's on that list.
The picture's dead.
Where is she?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
My two favorite girls.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Hello?
Where are you?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
What I do to Simone?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Absolutely not!
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
-- Flesh is weak.
"Straw God" changed my life.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Your mother couldn't make it?
She still with Kent?
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
Do I know you?
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
You could play the lead.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, are you there?
Good morning, Simone.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Why, Malcolm?
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
What were they hiding from?
No.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
You want to ask me a question?
Where should I look then, Cole?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Did you think the play sucked big time?
What do you want more than anything?
Something happened, didn't it?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
I'd give anything to have been there.
You know that accident up there?
You can see her?
Where is she?
Cole, you're scaring me.
You see ghosts, Cole?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
How did you--?
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Could take a little while, though.
Get off his case sweetie.
Suzie???
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Dammit, Carl!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
"Peggy-Sue" --
Curt Cobain.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Are you crazy?
He means moon shining.
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Throw me one.
Ow!
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Down boy.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Yeah. That's just the problem.
So?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Getting ready.
No --
Listen to me --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
Carl.
Shit.
What?
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
That wasn't a good night, no.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Hey there, Chief.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Sure thing, killer.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I never danced in a towel before.
Welcome home.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Praise Jesus.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
What's he get if he wins here?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
So tell me about yourself.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Yeah.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Let's hit it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you stopping?
Why should I?
I'm begging.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
What's your pleasure?
No what?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Bandit?
Liquid gold.
Bandit I, do you copy?
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Never mind. It's nothing.
We're outta motion lotion.
Talk to me.
I'm all ears.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
Anything on the Swede?
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
What about the sheriff's task force?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Maroon uniforms?
No.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
But there were more of you?
Are you on a land line?
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
D'you talk to'm?
No, what did you say on the machine?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
My debrief --
...When did you know all this?
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
Shoot.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
True?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
What happened to Gibarian?
Where's his body?
You killed her!
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What plan?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
Not a very happy poem.
Is it intelligent?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
What's wrong.
But we fought.
You don't want me.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
What's wrong?
You said he was dead.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Chris --
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Snow, get up here, now.
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
Claire!
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
It's terrific Win.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
What did he say?
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
What about Neil?
You asked.
Good night, Mike.
Stop, will you?!
Stop being nuts!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
What do you want to do?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
You don't have to, now.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
She's got to identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
What did she say the down payment was?
Coming to bed?
What?
What did you do tonight?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
What about when she identifies him?!
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Wasn't your fault.
Are you in charge here?
Why should she come in?
Under the table.
Watch your step!
What're we having?
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Shooting.
Sexual tension...
Here you go, Pete.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
You get mugged or something?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Would you cool it already?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I suppose.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
Well, no.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Peter?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Yeah, Roz.
Absolutely no class.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
What's the match gag?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Ready?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Break it off!
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
You won't get off that cheap.
105-353.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
It is.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Jawohl!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
To the Brick Kremlin!
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
Grable, not Gable!
You're crying, Animal.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
What are you going to do?
Why the south latrine?
Says me.
Right.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
How do they know?
Go on.
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Ach so!
December seventh, forty-one.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Good morning, Sefton.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
Data?
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Data, are you all right?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Are any of them inhabited?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
Really? What do you feel?
What?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
We're within range, sir.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
This is the Nexus?
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Left behind?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Close to retirement?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Aye.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Captain, are you all right?
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
The royal...studs?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Tractor beam, aye!
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Why?
This planet is aging in surges.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Good shooting, Scotty.
What's wrong?
How many more?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Why would you do this...?
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Yours...?!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
David?... David!
Genesis, I want it.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
... He spoke of your friendship.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Bones!...
Share this with no one.
I ordered no interruptions.
My Lord... what are your orders?
You amaze me, Commander.
You're not going in there -- !
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Shore leave, Admiral.
But what if they went -- nowhere?
I still don't under --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
You did this -- in a day?!
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
I told you! I told you I saw a --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Well done, Commander.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
It's a long story.
We encoded four minutes --
I didn't expect anything.
It was just words.
I'm trying, David.
Let go -- he can't -- !
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
<u>WHY</u>?
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Yes, Spock.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
What's she doing here?
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
And why not?
May I speak, sir?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
Reliant's command...
Indeterminate life signs.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
That was close --
Hold your course. Look sharp...
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
He's not what I expected, Sir.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
I would accept that as an axiom.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
An experimental device, doctor.
Wake up, man, wake up!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
The top of what?
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
Thanks.
Then --
Or believe, I'll bet.
Do you trust me?
How will that be done, exactly?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
Wanna try it from the top?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Thank you, Admiral.
Where are you going?!
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
The late 20th Century.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
Status?
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Spock: Condition report!
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
10 seconds, sir!
Systems report.  Communications?
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Any luck...?
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral! There be whales here!
I'll have to re-energize.
Full power, sir.
The explosive override -- ?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Transparent aluminum?
Father...?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Deceive us?
There are days.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Really.
Chase me!
Won't he rust?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Will he live?
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Counselor?
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
... I'm not sleeping well...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
It's Cochrane.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Can you configure it?
Dispersive armor is holding.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Where?
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Yes.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
There is no invasion...
Did you need something?
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Were the two of you... involved?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Track their weapons fire.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Report.
They're bypassing Engineering...
I remember it made me sick.
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Or not to be -
Uh, Jim...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
They'll respect him now...
It takes a lot of effort.
Would you care to go topside?
My God, what happened here?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Torpedo room--?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
From Starfleet?
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, Captain.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Stand down your weapons.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
This is incredible -
Aye, sir.
Kronos, sir?
I always wanted to try that.
I hope you're happy.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Captain, our shields -- !
Surely not.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
WE volunteered?
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Never been this close.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
What is it?
Spock, I'm really tired...
Captain...
The peace conference.
Are you dining on worms?
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Gorkon's own man??
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
If you are logical.
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
That could take hours!
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Do you know where you are?
Why?
I do not understand.
No. I must deactivate you.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
To new worlds...
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
Yes, sir.
What do you imagine this is?
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
We are being hailed.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
Counselor.
I'm going to miss you.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

Cannon fodder.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
We're being hailed.
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's working.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Anything.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
It's not quite the face you remember.
You don't trust me.
Looking up at the stars.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Not so long.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
No -- this is wasting time.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
And?
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Right in line with that burning tree.
You have one with two beds?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Where's that?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Clarify that.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Hello George.
What's all this for?
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
What?
What?!
Money.
No gas.
Are you from up there? Space?
Horses.
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
But I must go here.
What is hitchhike?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Well... I'm going to go now.
What happened?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
The captain...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
It's bad.
Nobody knows.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
Are you angry at me?
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
What are you saying?
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
What?
They are beautiful.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
There.
Well...
I love you.
You sure this is your car?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Oh, Jesus.
To the same woman?
Where are you going?
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I told you...
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
We can't let you do that.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
Jesus.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Cut it out, Tran.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
What kind of things exactly?
What?  Right Here?
You were lucky, Max.
You alright?  Y'okay?
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Faith OK?
Jesus.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
So there never was a death squad.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
About what?
Charm.
It's alright.  He means it.
Commissioner Strickland.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
What's his name?
What the fuck are you doing?
That would be no.
I thought we were friends.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
And gives it to you.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
No it doesn't.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Whatup Lenny?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Those two guys were cops.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
There's a plus side?
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Mace... you're a girl.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
You run the plates?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Who knows.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Hi there.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
He said it was a clue?
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
I'll take it into consideration.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Miss me, Dave?
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Find the feet?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Jesus.
The tattoo?
Then there's the other issue.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Hello?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
All the same killer?
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
What happened?
Agent...
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Agent Mackelway?
Suspect Zero?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Koessler?
Speck is dead.
I don't think you understand.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
You've been through worse.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
You should call your Grandmother.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
I thought I was going to die.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
They're out of Glenlivet.
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Let me just check on my boy.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
A couple of high rollers like you?
What do you guys do?
Why not?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Lorraine?
Yeah, hold on.
Hi. Sorry about that.
How are you doing?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I miss you, Mike.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Hi.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
So I don't call either way.
I mean, I need the money.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I didn't mention her once today.
How many strokes?
Kinda money, huh?
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Thanks, man.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Pause it. 
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
How's it going for you two?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
That's right.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Wait.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Wake up, baby.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
It doesn't matter...
Double down.
You gotta do it.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Nice, baby.
What was the part?
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Sorry about interrupting...
She didn't like me, anyway.
He drives a carriage.
No. Doesn't that suck?
You guys are such assholes.
Which one?
What are you doing?
Was I money?
Please, don't mess with me right now...
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
How long do I wait to call?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
...against the computer.
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking now?
...You're just poking at it...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
You dick.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Sue...
Sorry man.
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
The Court gave you justice.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
You heard about your father?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
And this?
What miracles you do for strangers.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
I know about what you mean!
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Mike!  The party starting!
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Jesus, I don't know...
Will you give this to him.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
What about McCluskey?
Mike, why am I out?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
What time do they expect us?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Hello.  Kay?
He'll be OK.
I can't...
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Send some bodyguards.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Is he alive?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
We?
Hi Tom.
I'll come down.
You'd say if you mind?
Marge, you like everybody.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
I'm intruding.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I met him in New York.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
Good afternoon!
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I have to go to Venice.
And Rome.
Do you have any brothers?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I've got plans!
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Marge-maintenance.
What about Christmas?
You should watch that!
Hardly.
Mr Greenleaf.
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Okay.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Did he kill Freddie?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Marge? Where are you going?
It's all true.
How would you know that?
What's your secret?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Let's go.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Dickie, my God!
Of course. Aunt Joan.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
You're kidding.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Will we see you later?
And tomorrow?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
No.
Not guilty.
Tom, are you okay?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
And don't forget. I have the key.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
I really don't want to see anybody.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Is there a firing range around?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Why?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Huh?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
What are you doing?
But this is a porno movie.
This is sort of high class...
Hello, Travis.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Travis?
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
This I gotta see.
No, why?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
No, I'm serious, really...
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Stick up?
I have.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Can I see you again?
God, you are square.
Who's a killer?
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Why not?
How?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Wha -- ?
So howsit?
What's the action around?
Yeah.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Not really.
No.
Maybe.  Not really.
Thank you.
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Limp dick?
What are you doing?
Partners?
God's speed.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Whoa.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
We were in love... weren't we?
Well, there's got to be a way...
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Now, did you remember that, or...
What... do you remember?
Sir, that is true.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Yes... yes, I do.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Are you saying that he's...
Mother o'god...
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
We've been closed for a while.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Ha!
Jesus...
A few.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
What is it?
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
That's where you live.
Evening, Luke.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
You should watch what you say.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Exactly.
When'd you quit smoking?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Is there a young Tim?
You hungry, son?
I was wondering...
Thank you.
How do you like our little hamlet?
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
And what had you done?
Then why did she object to you?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I did.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Is smoking fun?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
And the white house?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
I see. How do I get down there?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Of course.
The little girl's name.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
Young woman cut herself.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Oh. I see.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Tell him about the party.
When do you think they'll come?
Maybe we ought to leave.
They're gone. The same pattern.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
He's not home.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Some of them are.
But how... how do you know my name?
How?
What are you? A policeman?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ouch!
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Yes, but...
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Will I be seeing you again?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Are you all right?
Last night? What do you mean?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
What it was, probably...
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
Santa Rosa?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
That... that... who was that?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
I'm cold as ice.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
He's not home.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But Richardson?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
We can't be sure of that.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Hear him?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
I thought this was a school day.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
This is a gift.
This is a gift you'll not return.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
Was the paralysis immediate?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
She would if she could.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You've been with Gray again.
I hate that picture.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
We won't.
That was a fucking hollow point!
You killed her. I saw it.
You lied at my trial.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You're him. Corvis.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
Daisy. How did you know?
This is where it happened. Right over here.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
... it connects you to me...
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Fucking crow.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
An accident, Nathan.
What is it?
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
You killed her!
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
Such power exists?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
He gave these to you?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
I thought that was only for bombs.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Did all these people die in wars?
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
How does he explain that?
You must have come a long way.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Well, we could--
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I wonder if we ought to--
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Everyone seems so-- 
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
What is it you want?
Just twelve.
Where are you going now?
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
No -- no, thanks.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Two down and two to go.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Don't!  Stop!
I'm my own man.
Where is she?!
What is this, David?
Leave him alone.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
What's that smell!?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
It was a dream, Star.
He looks dead.
We are...
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
He met a girl.
Lights out, Sam.
Where's Michael?
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Not funny, Sam!
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Say hello to Thorn.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
I'm really sorry, Max.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
I am?
What's your name?
Ouch.
Now you and David...
When?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
This room is mine.
Where are we going?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Mom's home?...
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Star.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Now why'd you go and...
Too damn dangerous.
How you doin', old boy?
What?
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Torch it over there!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
We should have jumped his ass.
Spaceship of some kind.
Neither will we.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
My God, what in hell happened here?
Anything?
Well, who's got access to it?
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
Tie up Clark, too.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
Maybe it ain't coming.
We should sleep in shifts.
Yeah!
Now how did you get hurt?
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Because you'll never die.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
My God... I saw this.
Yes...
Why did they built it?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
This has to end.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
And what of the Eloi?
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You're late.
You promised me flowers.
Alex, what is it?
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
I've been working.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
I know that --
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I can't do that --
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Did you hear me, lad?
Is there a lot of illness?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
And this is your "work"?
I don't understand.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Mara -- what -- ?!
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
Where do they take them?!
You know that's not true.
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Yes, sir.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Sir?
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
And what's that?
Yes.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
[Beat] You're his son?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Did you know my father?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
[Beat] What's your name?
You're just gonna walk?
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I gave you my dog tags.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
[Beat] You bled to death.
Do you really believe me?
Why?
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
You're sure?
They're not here.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
I've been ok.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
I think so.
How you doin'?
I don't understand.
No. I don't want it to.
My God you look exactly like him.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
And how do you know that?
You told me this was how it happened.
Who...who kills me?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
You know how to get there?
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Well, where are you from?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
What's this?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Hon.
Have a good day at work today.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Why?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Hey.
No!
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Good God.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Oh shit.
Stop.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
So how come you don't have any kids?
Did you get married real young?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
That sounds nice.
I am the great and powerful Oz...
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Where'd y'all go?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Whose place is this again?
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Louise.  Where are we going?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Call him?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
That's puttin' it mildly.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Whaddo we do?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Before.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
What?!  What about him?!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Ready?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Thelma, that is not an option.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
You awake?
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
We've gone insane.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Isn't it beautiful?!!
We been seein' you all along the way.
Yeah... sure did.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
I'm asking you to leave.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
His mother?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Shoot.
Check.
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Here, just have one of these then.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
How'd you know that?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
I know he's around here someplace.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Fuck!!
All set.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Are you okay?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Friend. Baseball bat.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I see where you're going.
I'd go with the seven.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Holy shit...
Magda!
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I think you'd better sit down.
Oh yeah. Fine.
So who you taking to the prom?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
What's that?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Please leave.
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Get over here.
I, uh... I got it stuck.
It.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
One guess.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
Good.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
My father --
And?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
What's it about?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
John. How much time?
Max.
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
What's happened?
How's my favorite President?
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
I was eating that.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
What's that?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Yeah.
What's this about?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
I got one up on ya.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
Her oil pan is shot.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
So what?
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
That's not solid.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
He's gone.
What about the water...
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
You take care.
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
Thank you.
What?
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
X21. Come back.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Ray...
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
You ever try solitary confinement?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
That's a big comfort to me.
Yeah, most likely.
I thought he'd never leave.
I beg your pardon.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
What would?
There you go with those moves again.
Lieutenant...
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
How about what?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
Let's make it at eight.
Why'd you do that?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
You want to go ballistic?
And now I want you.
I want it understood.
Well no...inverse order.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Lucky charm.
...they say you're alright.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Where are we?
How do you play reality.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
I know exactly what you mean.
Well?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Is there something I should know?
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
Well, I don't know. That depends.
That's not what I heard.
Tom Kazansky.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What was that?
How was it?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
You ever done this before?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Great move. Great
What the hell is this?
Something bothering you?
What what are you doing? We're cover!
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
ON THE NOSE?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
Who's the hell is that?
You didn't help.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir..
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
I can take care of myself.
For the same reason you are.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
You may not think so, but you are.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
What to the rebels want?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Stop fighting and get out.
Kill him.
Bob?
I'm with an very important client.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Your sexual orientation?
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
You open it.
What is it?
HER!
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
What, aliens?
They found us!  Everybody out!
They sell fake memories.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I want that fucker dead.
He's not at ground level.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
And you believe him?
What are you doing?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
I love you.
I'm not interested in that.
I love you.
I don't remember you.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
She wasn't really my wife.
Don't be ridiculous.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
What can I do?
I don't need Kuato for that.
He's lying.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
How much you think?
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, we can take my truck then.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
You're really leaving, huh?
You didn't cook breakfast?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
So long, cactus!
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Oh, Jesus!!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
What the hell are they?
This is one big mother!
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
We'll take your word for it.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Its tires are flat...
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Watch your ass, shithead.
Use the fucking bomb!
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
You sure this is where it was?
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Ready?
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
I brought it... to the coroner.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
You can't remember that -- !
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
You're implying that I planted a gun?
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I embroidered.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
-- How could I help you?
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
I'd l-like to answer the question.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
You getting this?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Five years.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Here he comes.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Is there a golf course around here?
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You try that you little monkey.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
That would indicate that it's the future.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
No.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Noooo...
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Oh god, Laura.
Maybe I better start our homework.
What are you doing?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Laura, I am your friend.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
You got it.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Did you make me a tape?
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
It does matter. We're in love.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
I've got to see you.
What's going on?
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Laura.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Who was that?
No.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
How good's your intelligence?
He was accused of jury tampering.
Four cases in three years...
...tell me about this case.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
We thought it was just.
Yes.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
You would not...?
They lied.
I do. Yes.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Anything special about the case?
Thank you. When Debby...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am on the staff of...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Dr. Gruber...
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
Yes.
The most respected...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Hi.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
What did she say?
One hour.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Really. How wonderful for you.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
Thank you.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
...You saw her?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
...Gruber's not bad.
No.
You got a good memory, Franky.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
How are you holding up?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
What?
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
You seem to know a lot about him.
Did it do you any good?
I do know him...slightly.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
They've all stopped at the same time.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
How long was I out?
Nothing there now.
What was it like?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
They've blocked it!
That needle ain't pointing north!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
No, you don't.
Heather?
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Like what?
DO you mind...
Rex saved me.
He's on his way.
In my bed.
Heather?  You doing okay?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
You're not crazy, by the way.
Seemed, not was.
Really?
Holy...
Heather Langenkamp?
I'm sorry, I can't.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
That was Nancy, not me!
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Did we lose anybody?
Looks like weather.
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
You may not like what you hear.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Well, that's all part of it.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
Fine.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Where you going?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Why'd you do it?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
Do you have your ticket?
What the hell is going on?
What'd you do?
My parents don't do it anymore.
It was so real...
What are they doing?
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
What's your problem?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
What do you think?
It's outta here!
Swing up, son.
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
Yes, that's true.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Easy for you to say.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Need a hand?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Oh, many things...
But I'm wild at heart.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
You won't of missed much.
Hey baby...
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
What brand'd she smoke?
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
What's that honey?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Sailor?
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Sailor!
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
That don't smell like a More.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
How much we got left, honey?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
You're scarin' me, baby.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
How'd you know my daddy?
They have, sugar.
It's a comfortin' idea.
There's worse places, honey.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
You find any work?
Anything I can do for you?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Let's leave here.
I mean tomorrow.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
How can you say that, Sailor?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Wouldn't make any difference.
You need to explain it.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Actually... I just want to go home.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
He is. Take my word for it.
He lives with his mother.
Shit.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
You stay there.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
So modest.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Want some help with that?
Such as.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
I've been doing that a lot lately.
I've been trying to finish a book...
I know.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Hello?
...reconcile with Emily.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
So what are you doing out here?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Can I ask you something about her?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
He didn't give his name.
Washed up?
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Humboldt County?
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Carvel.
Outside Scranton.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
It feels really... good... here.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
But, last night...
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Want a bite?
What would you call them then?
I'm not going with them.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
I'm a little worried, James.
So what are you going to do?
That strikes me as odd.
Jesus.
You go first.
Is that Cristaile?
And? Are you going to tell him?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Well...
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
Sara.
And the jacket?
You don't deserve me, you know.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Oh?
Is it good?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
And?
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
One hundred and twenty feet.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
What are you doing?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Fucking Mariners.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
C'mon, Walter.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
They're starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
I'd love to hear it.
Were you watching me?
Don't you have friends?
Okay?
Too much sun.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
You don't know?
I wasn't feeling well.
What's with the boxes?
I'd say you're moving.
I'd keep away from him.
Just trying to be helpful.
I'm twelve.
Robin?
You should go home.
You seem a little hostile today.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Why not?
It was just an idea.
That's right.
It's very good, indeed.
Try it.
How do you feel about that?
You have no feelings for your niece?
Then why are you talking about this?
How long is this going to take?
You couldn't say.
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
No, I am not going to --
Where are you?
How old are you and your sister?
But roughly, how old?
And what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing there?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
I'm only asking questions.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
How do you feel about that?
What?
There's something wrong with this picture.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
Tell me about it.
How about in the morning.
Molested little girls?
Sorry.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
I've got problems.
Sneak up behind me like that.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
How you guys doing?
Okay so far.
I'm taking you back out.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
What happened?
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Son of a bitch!
Alright, put this on.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
No, Bud, no... not you.
Is that it?  Is this right?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
You better not say you missed that.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Hippy, you pussy.
Quiet!  Quiet!
SHIT!
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Stand by on the ROV.
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
Which one shall I wear?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Shall we go for a swim?
Nothing... nothing at all!
Any news?
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I'm too sleepy.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Have you ever been in love?
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
Why don't you try?
What other boat?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Thank you.
Whose boat is that?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
I would like to ask you something.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
No.
Yes.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
No I'm not.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Who?
Do you think he loves you?
And you like that?
Something I ate.
I got sicker.
I fell asleep.
Yes.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Are you married?
No questions.
What else did she tell you?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Agnes...
Did your mother see angels often?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Sometimes, yes.
What did you do?
What did you do?
You can tell me.
She's dead isn't she?
How?
Yes?
She tells you you're ugly?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Who am I?
And why am I here?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Would you like to tell me?
And then what happened?
Of what?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Agnes, can you hear me?
Him.
I hate him for what he did to me.
I hate him.
What did you do?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Larry...
Something they... that they overlooked.
Thanks. 
Martha, it's you.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
How did she hide it during the day?
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
I've already told you what I thought.
Who?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
Not simple, no.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I am...
How?
All right, what do you need.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
When was that?
Do you know what she did to her?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Bullshit yourself!
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
I doubt that's what she'd say.
That's enough.
Of course, John.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah.
Oh, it's all right.
Why aren't you at work?
Sure.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Ever seen one of these before?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
Grotty?
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
Get him out of here!!
Gerron.
What's up?
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Oh, there you are!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Go away! You've spoilt it.
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
What are you?
Pity.
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Where are you off to?
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
What are they saying?
And we're looking after him, are we?
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Clean though, isn't he?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Gie's a kiss!
Let's go and muck in.
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
No.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
Oh you are, I know you are.
That's what you tell me.
You're a window rattler, son.
Well!
And?
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Eh, what's all this?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Where's Irth?
Activate lifter quads.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
What is it?
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
Breathe deeply.
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
What happened to the lights?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
And when will you be ready to do that?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Hey now, what is this?
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
We've got six hours left.
<u>How</u>?
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
What?  What was that?
What do you mean, no?
What's happening up here?
Blow the ship up?
What'd he say?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
There, it caught!
<u>What is it</u>?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
It's stopped?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
We do know that.
Oh my God.
What the hell happened?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Martin?
This ship is full of cat hair.
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
Where did the parasites come from?
We won't need it then.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Yes!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
It was time for that a couple days ago.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Minh...
Seal everything now!
I found it...
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Not yet.
What the hell are you doing?
Wait.  Lost it.
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
What happened?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
And...?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Already working on it.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
Thanks.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
You have to...
Jesus.
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Hello, there. Who are you?
And what is your name?
You're more than modest.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
What do you mean by that?
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
I don't think I'm going.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
She was magnificent.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Bill!
Nothing?
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Bill...
You're my girl, aren't you?
Happy birthday, darling...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
It's all over.
Addison-!
Paranoiac!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Never try to outguess Margo.
A cowboy.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Why what?
I don't have to. I want to.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Ah...
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Lemme fix you a drink.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Why not?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
What are you doing here?
That's all.
Not at all.
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Hello, Miss Channing.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
May I have your coat?
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
But the raves about your performance-
I think I know...
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
She knows enough not to be here.
Congratulations, Eve.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
No, don't go...
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
He's in love with you.
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
Coming?
Margo, again...
That's on time for Margo.
What time is it?
Lloyd, be careful...
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
How's the new one coming?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
She's your understudy.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
Hello..
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
You get quick action, don't you?
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Promise.
Are you breaking the contract?
--it was fine the way it was--
--no way--
Carl?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
July of '71.
What's that?
Goddamnit--
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Who's first?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
Goddamnit--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
What's the matter?
--Jesus--
Woodward?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
--what time is it?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
Tell that to Muskie.
--you got more than one source?--
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
What's a real denial?
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
But they both worked at the White House?
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
Just tell me his title.
--I saw him. He verifies.
We can't talk inside either?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
They are not my clients.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
Your name, please.
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
What'd you get on W.House?
Who's Colson, Harry?
That was awhile ago.
--no--
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
This.  Right now.
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Me too.  For the most part.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Um...Chris --
Hi...
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
So we're gonna be close next year?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
What about the game?!
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
Do you?
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Ow, what the hell?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Hey, where's Finch?
You can send me the address too.
That's stupid.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
I still think you're okay.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
So you need to change, right?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Ho-lee shit.
Vicky, wait.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Victoria...I love you.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Either way works for us...
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Ha-ha!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Salots! Shitfucker!
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Like an underground club?
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Andy! Holy shit!
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
They're coming!
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
What the fuck!? You too!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
We don't both have to die.
No wonder he let her go.
God. I can't believe it.
What does it say?
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Oh God. Shit...
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
The ADM. Let's go.
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
What?
Andy...
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Uncle Terrence.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Where is it! Please!
Claude.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Why would he pick this one?
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Here.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Saint Severin...
Where is your home, Anya?
Who did you hear it from?
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
No! I look ridiculous!
Poor Meetoo!
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
You never thought of the possibility?
Come on up!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Who are you, child?
Don't you, child?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
I'll show you!
Please, if you'd just listen...
She does.
Can I have your autograph?
It's an important issue.
What do you mean, next?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Allison.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
We've been through this.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Oh!
I-you know, I don't wanna.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
He was creepy.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Uh, you're driving a-
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Your grammy!
God bless.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
what I mean?
Really, do you think so, really?
We can digest our-
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.
Here, you want some?
Yeah?
And blind people, crippled...
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
That's the key question.
I know you've only known me a short while.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yes, it is.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Uh-uh-why?
Really?
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Were you always funny?
You're so sure about it.
Well, what is your definition of following?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
Oooh.
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Yeah, where is the spider?
Two?
Yeah?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Christ!
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
What-
I can think of another word.
Are you?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
Probably on their first date, right?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Yes.
Charlie Chaplin.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Yeah, watch the road!
I have some very good memories there.
Oh.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
You all right?
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
All right-so we can afford it.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Yeah.
Did you know the contractor?
Was it a contractor?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
I have a small window of time.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
You should have brought him.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
I'm the hired help.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
So?
The suspense is killing me.
You need to call your dad.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
What?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
In the kitchen.
Two minutes.
Okay, knock it off.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
About me!
Don't.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
That's under lock and key.
We have a gift?
Yes, she is.
No.
Joking.
You lose this?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Easy tiger.
What am I, five?
Lemon or raspberry?
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's very nice.
I think there are sixteen there.
What?
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
How's he doing?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
I'm so sorry.
I was impressed.
The Shostakovich.
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Panes is here!
She's all over him, are you blind?
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Everyday.
Well, something's wrong.
So tell me, how's it going?
You're keeping a record, are you?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Enough about me.
Well good.  Thank God.
What do you mean, thank God?
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Break's over.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
You dance...
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I order you to find out where we are!
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Water...water...
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Of course not --
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Z!  Over here!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Not that one.  Or that one.
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
...Not enough food?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
What do you see out there?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
This the place?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
What did I tell you?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Twenty-seven.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
You mean tonight?
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
I forgive you.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
You all right? What's the matter?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Here. How about some breakfast?
His apartment?
Something wrong with your legs?
Your stomach?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
No doubt about it.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
I would.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
I see you bought some napkins.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
I mean, after that?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
We're going to finish that gin game.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
The Vice Squad?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Who?
Oh.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
I'm not through with you yet.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
How would you like to go tonight?
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Put me down for Thursday again.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Naturally.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
No key!
I dig.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Mr. Sheldrake?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
What's her name?
Any of that coffee left?
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Yeah, wasn't I?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
You got a girl-friend?
Not so rough, honey.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
And what happened to you?
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
What for?
That's right.
How long has it been -- a month?
I don't believe you.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
What do you think?
Coming?
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Are you there, Fran?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Where do you live?
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
How long were you up there ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
A sauciere --
What are we doing here?
What'd he say?
Flood.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Well, get in there.
What the hell is it?
You didn't like him.
Touchy.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
What -- happened here.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
They far enough?
What do you mean?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Change.
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
What's the furthest you been in?
What'd you do for supplies?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Go away -- hide yourself.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
And you admired him?
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Were you with him, when...
What's this tiger shit?
What?
Captain Willard?
This boat's a mess.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Cognac?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Well , who's in command here?
20   CONTINUED:  
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
117  CONTINUED:  
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
165  CONTINUED:  
165  CONTINUED:  
184  CONTINUED:
27   CONTINUED:
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Have you talked to Eric?
What happened here?
Was there any trouble?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Be careful, okay?
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Have to get these wet things off.
Told you I'm fine!
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
What's wrong?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Why the smirk?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
It's Sam Wilder!
How was it talking to him?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
I know. He's just the best.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
So what are you doing with a dog?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Oh, please...
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
What about your mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
I'm not kidding.
Okay.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Stop asking everyone.
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
You don't owe me that.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll never forget you said it.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
The two might go together.
Okay to say something now?
Boyfriend?
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Was this supposed to be your room?
How to die, mostly.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
How's Verdell doing?
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Shall I get her for you?
Absolutely.
What?
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
I brought you Chinese soup.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Because...  ... you love her?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Picking on me won't help.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
What?
Probably.
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Such language in front of a lady.
What?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Who is the mark?
Is this how it went, Nick?
A player?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Twenty large?  That's all?
Now what?
An assassin?
Why?
Forget it!
Why?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Yeah.
With computers.
It looks like white's game.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
No, they didn't.
Women?  No... not really.
Why?
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Hey, where are you?
Not even a stalemate?
In Costa Blanca.
Breakfast.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Ten years ago.
What happened?
What did he want?
What did he say?
Was that it?
They're worth less points.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Yes.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Attraction is a complication?
What happened to her?
Did you --
Was she the only one?
When did it start?
Martin.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I'm taking off my mike.
Was nice.
I thought it was interesting --
I prefer it like this.
Is that all you want?
Can I ask you a question?
Why didn't you fade?
How would you like the funds?
Of course, senor.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Oh yeah, what's that?
Like Custer huh?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
That stinks!
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I'm an idiot?
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
No, We aren't going to do it.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Yeah, no problem.
I made a deal with Josh.
You're sure?
Yeah, pretty well.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
If you get out can we be together again.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Seems a shame!
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
This is your doing?
You will wish you hadn't.
Enjoying our hospitality?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Hey Doug, where you been?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
So, he didn't fire you?
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Have you lost all control of this city?
So go dance.
She asleep?
Why not?
To see your father?
A late night or an early morning?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
Don't call him a dipshit.
You.
I'm very sorry --
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
'Is it really me?'
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
I'll get something for us to drink --
You think so.
Because I try to be nice to people?
What is that?
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Looking for intelligent life?
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Oh. Just not at school...
You were great the other night.
Maybe you inspire me.
It's a start.
What does that mean?!
Your turn.
Come on.
How do you know this place?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Ergo?
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
What are you thinking?
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
It's gone now.
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Materially or spiritually?
You have materials for the side bearings?
You're marrying again.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Learn anything?
Huh?
You remember me...?
What time does school start around here?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Why what?
Operator...
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
March 11th.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
That's all taken care of.
You didn't?
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
Obviously!  
Gone?... Where?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
You lost that one?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
You like people?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
What for?
Doing what?
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Is that all there is to it?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Don't call me stupid.
I can look and see.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
I'd like to get out of here.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Everybody loves trout.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
This your place?
Fine.
You didn't walk out here.
Who are you?
Okay, friend. Start running.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Not me. No way.
You okay?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Dead.  Damnit!
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Got a casualty list?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Another 'you'?
Never.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
It's a spittin' image.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
Let him go.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Before what?
Barton!
...This'll sometimes help.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
How long you been up there, Fink?
I beg your pardon?
...Huh? No, I'm –
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
A souse!
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Go ahead, son.
What do you mean, Barton?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Howdy, neighbor.
...Got a sweetheart?
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
...Can I come in?
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on –
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Jesus... They can tell that...
Jesus... You're leaving.
Yeah, but Charlie –
You'll be back?
...Yes, thank you.
I – Mr. Lipnik –
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
...Okay
L.A.P.D.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Well, some of his throat was there.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How about the booze?
No?
How's not smoking?
What was she like?
Catherine Tramell.
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
What is this interest you've got in her?
Why did you change your name?
What are you doing here?
How long were you dating him?
Did you leave the club with him?
Was there anyone with you last night?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
You like playing games, don't you?
I'm tired.
I passed.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Ice?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Why does he do it?
Yes.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
What did he say?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
How did he die?
It teaches you to lie.
What kind of drugs?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
He had a girlfriend?
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Was she ever suspect?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
You feeling better?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Catherine says you don't like her.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Where the hell you goin'?
What was the motive?
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
You knew her, didn't you?
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
What do you think?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Piss painting?
That was my favorite part!
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
Who is it?
No.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
When?
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
A primate?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Would you like to see the wine list?
You want me to put it here?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
I don't really have any problems.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
You do! You definitely do.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
You're back.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Don't you think he's using you?
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
I really... admire you.
Would you check out my studio some time?
Hi.
Some of them.
Come on.
No, I'd like the scarf.
You're a fast mover.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
You don't have any!!!
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
Well that's a ... long story ...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
And the truth frightened her?
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Y'mean frame him?
Son!
You buy this "blurry" business?
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
But I can't can I?
Women.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Please be looking for me.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
You're loosing your cool
Nice suit.  And today you are?
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
No!?
You're not even listening to me.
I wouldn't bet on that.
Who's Ivy?
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
No gun.  How disarming.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
You will rescue my wife
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
The dreams again, sir?
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
How are you feeling, young man?
Letters in the alphabet.
How about, MR. E.
What now sir?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Up here, Al.
Why's that?
He's home. I sent the signal.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Edward...
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
GET IN THE CAR!!
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
How'd you find this place?
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Great.  Give me a grant.
No.
Odd desire for anyone.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I missed you, Lieutenant.
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
And what happens if we say no?
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
... Why the mask?
How'd you know it was me?
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Peanuts?
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Yeeees?
There aren't hotels?
Do we know anything about him?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Sort of half.....
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
It's very good Bernie.
And howls Alison?
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Of course.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
What's gone?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Turd-burglar...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...Two...
Talk ta me, Bork.
You see what I see, Bork?
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Really? That's where we're from.
You'll be rich!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
She's ready.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
Anything happen while I was away?
Cabin fever, hon?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
My God, we're back where we started.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
She's only fourteen...
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Just get some people out of our house.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
-- Like you used to be?
No.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
Tell the truth.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Three syllables.
I don't know what that signal means.
God, you're anatomically correct!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's your cousin.
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
What's wrong?
You don't have a key?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
What's happening to them?
Is this the key to the attic?
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I would like to watch television.
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Your leg must be getting better.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
To watch...? To watch me...?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Can you see well?
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Bravo!
No, Ben.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Have you served in the Army?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Correct.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Sid, it's useless!
You heard?
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
It's that gardener!
No! He's a real gardener!
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Ben!
... Well?
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Malkovich.
Thank you.
Morning.
Enjoy.
Which one is Elijah again?
Why, Craig. why?
Yeah, just an idea I had.
The iguana.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
Why?
So how was it? What was he doing?
You've always hated the animals.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
The monkey.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
Holy shit, yes!
Sure, after a fashion.
Yex?
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
No. I understand perfectly.
Dr. Lester. . .
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Moving story.
Emily Dickinson.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Yeah.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
Anybody else?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
We have to meet.
Yeah, I saw them
How do we do that?
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Is there dancing?
Can I get you a drink?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Stay in him forever?
Folks came.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
You saying nothing counts?
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Your mother all right?
You grown.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Could be that fall you took.
I know what I see.
True.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
What run him off? Tell me that!
He knew Baby Suggs?
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What, baby?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
What? What? You talking back to me?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Hiya Allan.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Her life is in your hands.
Excuse me?
Yeah.
What's this?
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Sheesh.
What tied the room together, Dude?
I was bowling--
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
Kill that poor woman.
Am I wrong?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
No, they--
Yes, heh--
No.  Here.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Oh, no.
Yeah, but what about--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Finder's fee?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
This was, uh--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
What the fuck are you--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Huh.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
Have it your way.  The point is--
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Walter!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
Walter--
"Our" car, Walter?
That wasn't her toe.
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Who the fuck is that?
Uh-huh.
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Huh?
It is a fucking emergency.
Oh, shit.
Walter, you fuck!
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
It's a heart attack.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
You monsters!
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Smokey Huh?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
Where to first?
What is it with you people and pain?
What was that?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
How do you feel?
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
Where were you, Whistler?
Your security's for shit, kid.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Whistler, I --
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
But, he could've --
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
Like what?
You don't look so good.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
How long have we been driving?
Is it bad?
It won't work on you.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Please --
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
How many of you are there?
Whistler!
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
--and if she ever did--
What, are you alright?
No.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Inside the grave?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Why?
Something was wrong.
What's she look like?
Oak?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
Druid Hill Park.
Looks like business is booming.
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Jesus.
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Your body, your call.
I think we get the gist.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--like you hurt the baby--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
How'd you know they were--
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
This is a little nuts.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
I don't believe this.
What I never could figure about the movie?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
What about night?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Where's Domini?
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
That's a "j."
--Cotter--
What're you doing?
How're the cameras doing?
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
What?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
What?
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
Jesus.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
--I know!
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
"It's why the witch kills children."
What the fuck's going on here?
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
--yes--
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Abby. What's the matter?
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Ray?... What time is it?
...You called me this morning.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...So?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
What's the matter?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...What?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
...Count it if you want.
What's this?
This.
That's not the point.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Is Marty here?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Frank. Come in.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Come into the study a minute.
What is this? What color is it?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, baby.
Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Can I feel 'em?
Bull.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Sure I'm alright. 
Do you like me?
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Falling.
Come in.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me. don't you?
Shut up.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Oh no.
Yeah, it's me.
Who, Dorothy?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
How is Central these days?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Are you alright?
Yes. I do.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Okay. thanks.
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Did you see her undressed?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Okay. be careful.
Everything okay?
You didn't tell him about me?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Really?
Hi Dad.
What time are visiting hours?
I'm going out for awhile.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
On the plane.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
No honey, I'm alright.
Blanca, por favor.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
This is it for me.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Tuna, this is crap.
Goodness.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
No, my brother.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
What type of planes do you have?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Diego?  It's George.
Good to see you, Diego.
What's the matter, George?
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Derek Foreal.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Who's the cheapskate?
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Tell Mom, you know...
I meant every word of it.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
Look what the cat dragged in.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Jesus Christ.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
But this is...
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
I don't know.
Well, here I am.  See?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I didn't mean to...
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Stoned?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
What's happened to you?
What ... What must I decide?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Of course. As soon as possible.
Can you read?
Where's Kader?
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Take some time off.
So she knew about his heart?
What about the will?
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Did they argue the day before he died?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Objection sustained.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
I've got work to do.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Her name?
How did he look?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How long were you together?
What happened next?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Did you suggest any?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
What did you prescribe for her?
October twenty-seventh.
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
No.
Where did you meet him?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes.
No.
Three fifteen.
P.M.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
I'm the photographer.
Yes -- she did.
Yeah.
You and me -- making love.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Rebecca -- take these off.
You killed him -- didn't you?
You don't need anybody.
I'm dropping the case.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
I love you.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
This is not relaxing.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Not even if they're a dork?
It had to get there somehow.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Eeeww!
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I can't believe she's making jokes.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Not yet. You want to go?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
She's changed.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Madge?
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh. When did you move back?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
About a year and a half.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Help cook?
What?
And did you?
When?
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Francesca?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
You must get lonely at times.
Woman friends, too?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Francesca?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
It's Robert.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Can I help?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
What were you like when you were younger?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
You're somewhere else, where?
Uh-huh. And?
Am I too heavy for you?
I... What do you want?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
How do you know what I experience?
What do you want me to say?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
I don't know. Please...
What about your husband?
What time is it?
I'm positive.
Want anything special for dinner?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
You soundin' like the old man now.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Is this Hell?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
But.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
You know I can't.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Have you ever been inside?
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
The dead get out?
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
Where is it?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
What the hell do you want?
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Where is it?
The money!
Caesar!
I didn't expect --
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
They were early.
That doesn't make any sense.
Violet, please!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
You can't leave.
Tell them!  Tell them!
...  maybe three hours.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Violet!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Now that's teamwork.
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Who?
Are they really?
Truck.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
How did you meet him?
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Yes.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
That's his brother.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
What did Gino drink?
Where will you be?
I'm just asking, what if?
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
No.  We can't risk it.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I think so.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
So now you know.
I don't think so.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Paris?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
You are a friend of his?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Was it the break-in?
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
I said ten thousand.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Okay, so you're a victim.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
We're about an hour away.
Where?
Okay, so...
Look, I don't know what's up there.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- just --
He came to kill us.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
xxxxxx.
Who is it?
xxxxxx
And that's it?
What was I thinking, right?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
He run away often?
Wait a minute --
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
Tell him we're busy.
What?
You drink rum?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
If I can help you ...
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Sam!
Hello, Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Jack!!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
So what are you going to do about her?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Say it was a mistake.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Jack, she's innocent!
How could you do this to me?
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Where do I get it stamped?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Don't litter my cab!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Where are you taking me?
It's heavy.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I'm going to open it!
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
He is dead.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
I know that.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
Sod it, it's broken!
My mother said it would be all right.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
What have you done with his body?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
But I could be anybody.
Now look what you've done to him.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Can you fix it?
Are you expecting anyone?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
Frank Pierce.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
What about Kanita?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
No. He's dead.
Sure, sure, give go.
Is he going to be alright?
He's very very sick.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
You shouldn't smoke.
He's dead, huh?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
I think I'd remember that.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Don't seem so bad to me.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Promise you won't go inside.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
I hate vodka.
Last show of the night.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
Whatja doing?
Mr. Oh.
Let's get in a fight, then.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Well why didn't you say so?
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
You're in the stomach!
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Shit, shit, shit...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
No.  No.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
No.  Don't worry about it.
You packing up tonight?
I don't think so.
He excels at gratitude.
Eventually rising to...
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Okay.  Let's do me.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
Of course.
Watch? --
Well, whatever you think.
Yes.
Yes.
Did it really go well?
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
I think you're the Devil.
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Let's go...
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Do it then.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
It's Aaron.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Because...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
How do I get out of here?
No...no.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Is everything all right?
Ernie, they're calling from work.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
You don't have to finish tonight.
Go ahead.
Hi.
If we could just eat first.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
They said it would be okay if...
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
So he was indicted?
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
It's incredible who's here.
You okay?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
Uh-huh.
Hello?
Then give me a minute...
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I knew what you meant.
Take it easy.
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
I'm almost ready -
Not even a little bit?
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
What the hell's going on?
Look at the size of it!
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Did you hear what he said?
I mean, you look so pretty.
Goodbye.
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Put it in the middle of the room!
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
There's that weird dude again.
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
What did he say?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Hiya Carla.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
How ya doin'?
I also saw the girl give you this.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
I- don't know what you're talking about!
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
You're gonna shoot me!
Well I'm overjoyed.
After that we go no more!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
Well, I'll go home with you.
I don't think so Mayolia.
You don't have to do anything!
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I look horrible.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Nice game.
It's coffee.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Did you see a girl come by here?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Dying.
He doesn't look fifty.
Something like that.
What show is this?
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
You left me a message?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
How are you doing?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Where are you gonna go?
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
You sure?
Why'd you come back?
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
Dress, huh?  What for?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Beverly Center.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Am I in trouble or something?
What are you talking about?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
How do you know all this?
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Ow.
All right.  What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Put your head back.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
I want to die.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
All right.
No THX.
That is so cool.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Hi, guys.
I haven't seen him tonight.
The mark of the Coven.
Okay, let's go.
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
What happened?
You're kidding.
Buffy!
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Ah, you'll be coming back.
You said "Crash".
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
No.
I'll tuck you in.
Fundamentals?
I think you're real cute.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
You should be at the game.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
It's possible.
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
God bless you.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Don't bump me.
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Fastball.
How come you don't like me?
What do I got?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
I'm trying to thank you.
You're a great catcher.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
Step outside, pal.
Take the first shot at me.
Don't try me.
She's playing with my mind.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
What'you want, kid?
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He even played golf with the President.
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
You should say so.
Just say so.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
All right.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Seven o'clock?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Hello.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
...position...
...and she doesn't always -
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Sam, we got a problem.
I'll be right back.
She took care of the dealers...
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
You sure?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Oh, it's so soft.
Hi. Nice to see you.
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
Huh?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Yeah.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I was with somebody.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Oh...
Fuck you.
Get - Get up! Get up!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Should I let her in like - ?
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
It won't happen again, Sam.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
Excuse me.
Is this yours? Your pen?
When I left here with the money...
I don't want to go to Europe.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
And here. Here.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
It's instinctive, you know.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
And I mean... that's no good.
Of course, Remo.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Ace.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Uh-huh. Good.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Sure.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Let me think about that.
You know?
Hm.
No, he's not.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yeah.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
You fucked with me for the last time!
Yeah.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
...all the luck in the world.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
He's sittin' by the phone -
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
...they're in Penthouse K.
They checked in alone.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Hey, how you doin'? 
Wow.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Mm.
I know. I know.
Don't know.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Charlie M?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Tony.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
What's the matter with you?
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Hi.
Yes, uh...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
How heroic of you...
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Are you sure?
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Selina, are you okay?
We're waiting.
God, can you hear me!
What's the catch?
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
You like them, don't you, Boss.
I loved you.
You think so?...Selina?
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
I'm a good mother!
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
I don't know what came over me.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Hey, Captain God!
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Did you try to kill...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Okay, deal.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Will you two cut it out?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
What's this?
Lady, don't let him do it!
I told you I should've cuffed him.
He's seen both of us now.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
That's your "rep."
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Lose the hardware now.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Lady, try making some sense.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Don't lay this on me!
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Please.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
Hey drop it, okay?
Our house always needs touching up.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
It won't be him.
Why tell me this?
You can't give up.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Who's in back?
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
You, I would've noticed.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
I'm still okay.
Did you hear that?
What's Nels' number?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
That's a reasonable possibility.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Know what else is in here?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
Where do we meet?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Satisfied?
I don't know what you mean.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Negative.
And not a nickel.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Where's the backpack?
I'm in awe.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
It takes all types.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
You see that, Col?
Fuck it, is what I say.
Fuck off, Dave.
You fucking promised.
Jimmy.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Do you mean that?
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
No.
Everybody wants something.
You on the game?
Why?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Come on, Dil --
Sorry, darling.
So I'm sorry.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Dil, this is Jude.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You said anything, Dil
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
So it's true, then?
You like me better like this.
So tell me.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
What would you do for me?
What's Fergus?
You've got to go now, Dil --
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Fergus!
So what do you need, Fergus?
See does he want some.
Did you give him it?
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
And what if I say no?
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Why?
He's at home.
Hope not.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
How did you know it was her?
Well, I could say the same about you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Hey --
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
Didn't look like that to me...
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Never.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Now put it back in.
Don't know her.
See if she's all right.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
When I was a child...
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Faster than cricket?
I said you bastard -- stop --
What?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
And you know what?
Not here.
Come and get me, soldier --
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
No -- I guess not.
What?
What's the matter?
You don't look so bad in this light.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Yes, you told me.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
Of course there is!
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
Reggie -- please believe me!
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
Only we call them agents.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
That's the spirit.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Yes -- ?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
What now?
Sorry about that.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Your --
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
You can't.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Whitefoot, of course.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
What are you doing?
What day is it?
Or Tex?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Yes, I know.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Reggie -- open the door.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
Yes.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
The money is unimportant.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
What do you mean, no?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
He was a wealthy man?
About how wealthy would you say?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
I was, too.
Oh, la.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
But he is gone.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Is your husband with you?
Shakespeare never said that.
Are you in the book?
Instant divorce you mean?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
We're here.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Stop that!
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Who is it from?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Yeah?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Hi honey.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
What happened?
She was murdered?
Can you get inside?
Why?
You fucked me up!
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Someone tried to kill me.
You ok?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
This place is empty.
I got to get home.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
I'm making you feel like meat?
Jody. Wait.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
I need to ask you something.
Lisa Sherman?
What?
Where are you going?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Yeah.
On what side of the family?
You ok?
What are you doing?
What?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
You can have both if you want.
You're so beautiful.
Now don't be nervous.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
That wasn't me ...
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Stacy?
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
Where do you want this stuff?
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
You want cash?
Go on.
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.

It happens to this piece of shit...
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
 

Take your gun!
What?


Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...-er!
...I believe in live and...
...waiting!
Oh, shit.
...Shift.
...do we?

 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...wanna give it a try!
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on...
Whoo!
No.  Shit.
All right.
 Okay.  Okay. 
 Aw, shit  

...here!
Come on!

It won't even start half the time.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
Ow!  

Oh.
Arlo!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
And Brynner's right on...
Okay...
...tunnel!
Whoo!
Mason.
What?


Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
They'll meet you at the top.
You did help a little.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who put the big hurt on...
Patriotism is its own reward.
...face" crap you've been telling me?

Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...

I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Exactly.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Whoo-hoo! 
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
...-bility.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
No!
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!

No, go--
...that.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
Do you know what'll...
Hit him again.

This was supposed to be a...
Dennis!
I wanna patch in from...
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
....-lene.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
Yeah?
I want you to look at one another...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.



Dead, last time I...

Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
I would've in another life.
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
And don't give him any ice cream...

Video lock.
Forty-nine?
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
...-time. 
My secret?
...is a perfect hunter.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And what if it does?
 ...miles. 
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
Lying? 
...public drunkenness....
Let me see your...
...stole a truck under arrest.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Gimme this god-...
 Talk to me.

Oh.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
Do it now.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Then these are all new owners?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
How did she get that idea?
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Very.
Too bad?
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
What for?
Why is that funny?
Yes, his girlfriend.
Just find the girl.
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Hello.
She's just no good.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
...No...
What kind of guy do you think I am?
I'll throw that in too.
Why?
I'm not.
Where did you get this material?
Looking for someone.
I don't want it anymore.
I want the rest of the pictures.
What are you talking about?
That's it?
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
You and your husband never discussed her?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Would you like something to drink?
What?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Is there anything else you want to know?
I can't tell you.
For very long?
Over the water department, or over you?
Oh, yeah?
Never forgave him for what?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
We got it. We got it, baby.
I'll stay.
Working for the District Attorney.
As little as possible.
Hold still. Why?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
I know.
Do? To who?
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
She's too upset.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Yes.
Upstairs. Why?
Going somewhere?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Let me handle that.
Walsh here?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
He never even kids about it.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
He did or he didn't?
This?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
That's for sure.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Yes. I want proof.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Thanks for all you've done for me.
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
You understand now? You see it clearly?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Wasted?
What's the matter?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
Was the show covered by every department?
We haven't heard from him.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Almost two to one -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Where's the soap?
A rooster?
Is that what you want to do?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
What do you mean by that?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
First of all - 
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Hello, Brad.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What check?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Yes and no.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
What's this?
Well, if it's already too late...
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
You can hold me down.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Am I missing something here?
Why?
When did you get back?
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
I'm not pregnant.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
You don't have anything to do with it.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You mean, on a date?
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
He's not invited.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Who are you to make assessments?
Well, he missed!
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
Shit!
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Seven months.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Empire.
The Emperor.
I guess.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
What's he looking for?
The quest isn't going well?
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
There aren't.
No.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Because you buckled.
Don't yell at me, pal.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Julie Dwyer died.
Number six.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
She meant nothing to you!
No!
He made it, hunhh?
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
I want to rent a movie.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
May I be blunt with you?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Now I know you're lying.
What did she say?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Hey, what about Veronica?
You're a snake.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
You didn't have to choke me.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
Go open the video store.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Be careful.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
I said go ahead.
Here. Now leave me alone.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Why did you agree to come in then?
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
What were you doing up so late?
How much money did you leave up there?
I was kidding.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Why'd you hit me?
Three?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
All right. Name it.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
You sucked that guy's dick?
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Well...?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
What the fuck did you do that for?
A couple...?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
What are you talking about?
No way!
He really wants to play metal?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
That's the price, my brother.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I'm not sad.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Willam!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
You know how the airlines are.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Glad you could drop in.
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
What are we going to do?
She's tough.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Enough.
The winds are picking up.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I know...
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
Did I miss something?
Where?
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
I can't believe you just said that.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Pull it apart!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Reach up!  Do it!
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
What about you?!
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
On top of the peak.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Then where the fuck is!
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Go after her.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Right.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
I don't trust him.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
What's the code, Travers?
Rich...
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
What did you do that for?
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Good evening, sir.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
So this is the young man?
Fine, sir, fine.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
It's alright, thank you.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
I beg your pardon?
Do you feel that way now?
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
What crime did you commit.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Where is he now, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Fine, fine.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
What do I want?
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Yes sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
You've heard Beethoven before?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Carry on, Chief.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
D'you think we should do something?
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
You like being a lawyer?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Annie...it's Max.
This your current address?
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
No.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
I never bought that.
...if they're wrong?!
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
You on some kind of work plan?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Why not?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
You - you killed him?
No.  You say you're cool.
Good.  Help me out here.
What?
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
Max.
How about the thingy next to it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Get rid of 'em.
I can't believe this.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Let him go, Vincent.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
You go every night?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
How long have you been a hit man?
In case he asks.
Yeah, that.
It's what I do for a living.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
As in...? 
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow down!
Max?
What happened?
That's love.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
You going to warn him?
What was your horse's name?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
So why are they after you?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Has this happened to you before?
Who are you, Jerry?
That was him.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
We're going to Queens?
Connecticut.
Liza?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
I'm sorry.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Geronimo is down.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
I'm still listening.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
Where'd you get it?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
Hope there's a cartoon.
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
What is it?  What's happened?
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
Right.  Well.
What does it say?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
J39 Z186...?
Got a bogey, boss?
Dr. Cullers?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Could we hear to China?
Could we hear God?
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Can you show me?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
I didn't realize I was out.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
And in return?
What's that?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
I'd say this is slightly different.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Ellie.
That you, Valerian?
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
How do you mean?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
So.  The final countdown.
What...?
What?
What are you so afraid of?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
That's my baby.
Well, whatta we got here?
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Whatta you so happy about?
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
What you mean, Luke?
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Like I always do?
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
I'm in.
Kick a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Now look what you did.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
You bastard!
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
I thought he was lying.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
The door was already open...
Hello, Daryll Lee.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
But it's a different m.o.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Is that it?
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Who's the married man?
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
The lock...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Okay.
Michael Johnson.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
I heard. Good police work.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
You messed with the scene.
There was no sperm.
So what have we got?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Not a lot of action here.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
It's about time.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Are we allowed to park here?
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
I want to see my mother immediately.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
How?
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
Tell us every detail.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
Which flowers did you order?
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Honestly, Letty.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Guess which hand.
Really, this isn't funny.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
What's my rap?
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
This must be Beast.
Promise?
The store was busy.
Aunt Lily?
What is it? Are you OK?
What do you mean not taking your meds?
I love you so much.
What are you doing?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Getting back.
What?
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
A pass.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
No.
Hello?
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
-- Super what?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Someone else coming?
Uh, no --
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
And the other half?
I don't know.
Yeah.   We just go home.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
He said to go fuck yourself.
Turn on the flashlight.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
You're sure?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Hello?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
I'm from Belgium.
Why haven't you turned us in?
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What room number?
The map said to go left.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
I'll drive.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
You lived there. You know the city.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I think we went the wrong way.
How do we know what room she's in?
Algeria.
You got it in a bar?
Can't sleep?
Sounds boring.
Why?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Do you think you are a real master?
Why do you want to teach me?
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Hello.  What is your name?
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Put them down.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
This spells trouble.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Where is he now?
What do you want?
Let's stop a moment.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
She needs direction... and training.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
It's Jade Fox!
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
You buying?
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
My name.
They couldn't do anything for me.
Don't interfere.
Mom --?
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Does she have a name?
Do you feel okay.
You gotta go now, I bet.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Neither.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Don't waste my time.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Who got himself what?
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
You heard me.
Nothing.
So what year are you going into?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Oh really?
At this hour? I don't think so.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
How's the water?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Shut up.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
It was fine.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Somerset Maugham.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
I don't.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Because I'm in love with you.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
The football stud?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
What do you mean?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
If that's what you call it.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
I like it better when I'm on top.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Positive.
Yes!
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
One.
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
What are the terms?
Call me later.
Interesting.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Moving along quite well.
You amaze me.
Who are you spying on?
So? How'd it go last night?
Bad time?
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Not at all. What's wrong?
Ronald? That's crazy.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Right after we played backgammon.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I said, do you want some water?
What time is it?
Did you hit her?
Oh, hello.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
What are saying, darling?
What song, dear?
She was very pretty.
You're shouting at me.
Ollie.
Where did you get it?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Hello, Amy.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Can't you tell me later?
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
And who did the voice belong to?
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Daddy?
Who are you?
Can't you get it, darling?
I shall wear it in my hair!
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
It stands so still.
May I pet the deer?
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
I like stories.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
There was a sale.
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
How have you been feeling?
He's a very talented musician.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Where?
Hey, did you get contacts?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
So did you do it?
And then?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
What the hell is the tampon test?
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Hello?
You hungry?
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
My apartment's just such a mess.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Look what you did!
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Wow.
The Nielson's?
Script coverage?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
What are those?
What's wrong?
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
What's with the squirt guns?
Your breasts feel larger.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Peter I love you too but...
Be careful!
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
You can't believe this bullshit.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
He was found a few blocks away.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Madonna's in Penthouse?
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
He means the last that we know of.
You think mafia hit?
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Police.  Nobody move.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
It seems fine.
How can I submit this?
Who is it?
Why give yourself up?
People...  after me.
Don't know that either.
They didn't have faces.
Such a joker!  Like your father.
Where does it lead?
Someoneís after me.
Bad dreams?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Horrible...
What are you doing?
You're a liar!
You've been working too hard.
What is it?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
Is this dangerous or anything?
How much do you usually get paid?
What's with her?
For a month.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
I'm not certain about...
Dave...
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
.. Nothing.
Choices???
Die, you pond scum!
I don't give a shit.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's a homeless shelter.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
Uh-oh...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Thanks, I wrote it.
We've got to fix this.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Well...
I care about the homeless.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Oh... Yeah.
Where are you going?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
Are you hungry?
I know. I'm sorry...
You really believe that?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
It could be fun.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Please....shoot me.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Help me get him to the boat.
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
What is it?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Charlie Dalton.
How was dinner?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Yeah.
So?
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Oh God, it's over now!
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yeah?  Like what?
Yes sir.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Don't stop.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Well, sure!
Knox, I don't believe this!
Uh-huh.
What is that?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
All right!  What'd she say?
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Weird.
What is this, a midnight study group?
So what do you think of my father?
What?
I've found it.
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Come on, that's impossible.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Visit from my father.
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
Hanover, listen...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Yeah you did...
Looking good...
It's not them...it's it...
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
...Jagger was here...I was here...
I think he knows that Joey.
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
She's gone...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
Why don't you back off?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Someone's back there.
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
She fucked us both.
Fuel up. Need fuel.
That's mustard!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Nick's going?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Let's go!!!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
That's new, isn't it?
No, I --
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Holy shit!
Vince. Hey, you guys --
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
No?
Kind of. You didn't know?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Linda, what's the matter?
Okay.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
You're going hunting?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
I'm just so lonely.
You seem... disturbed.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
I just wait. You know?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Is he from here?
Hey, Nick?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
No.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
What's that noise?
Did you get one?
It's Merle, Sal.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Well, who'd you get married to?
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
You're full of shit!
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Down I would say... What would you say?
I want to see my wife and kid.
You're working a partner on this.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Nobody's looking.
Are you a cop?
I have to go home, Sanchez.
They're going to rob that bank.
Can I ask you something?
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
Why?
Married?
What's this place?
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Sanchez...?
You okay?
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
You be careful.
But he was such a good cop.
Seat's too high.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Bye.  Thanks.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
You could always take it off.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Mama!
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
What Grange?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
You're not -- Dorothy.
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Mornin', Jabez ...
No, no! Give it to me!
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
But -- I was just lucky.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
I think his leg is broken.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Mary--
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
We must go on home, Jabez.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
I'm serious.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Mary --
Why don't they come --
Mary! Come back ...
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
I want you to fix these fish!
Hello, Sheriff.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
What's that?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Jabez ...
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Me?
You mean -- a jury trial?
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
Where are you going?
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Go on.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
'Roy'.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Gene -- you smilin'?
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
What guns?
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah...
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
So!  Sal is with you?
I don't have a choice.
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
He wanted to kill me!
Okay, what do you give me?
What the fuck do you want?
We're all set at Kennedy.
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
What's the matter with you?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
The gun's right on your back...
Where's the back door?
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
You like me?
You all right?
Thanks again, Sam.
Did you always call him Junior.
You shouldn't start now.
You mean that?
... The bodies out the door.
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
To show that we're negotiating.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
They're trying to come through the door!
What?
Sal?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
Here's your document, Sonny.
Oh my God, mother!
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Of course not ...
This is Drake Bishop.
This is Bishop.
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
Where are we going?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
I don't know.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
How did you meet Choco?
Not really.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Fast and or furious.
You were good.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ya back is got.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
I own a brownstone on this block.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
How much?
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
I thank you.
I hope the block is still standing.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
I'll do.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
ML?
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Can you pay me now?
C'mon, Sal.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
No.  What are you gonna do?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Shit!  I forgot.
Tina, you're sweating.
It's cold.
Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Smack him back.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
I'll do that.
Whaddup.  Money?
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Get the broom.
Some are OK.
I'm listening.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
I didn't think so.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
Pop asked you.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Take it easy, Pop.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
No, I'm not it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
You did?
Excuse me?
O'clock?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Okay.
Mom, you know that never works.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Home school? What's that?
No no no no no.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
One day they'll find a cure.
Got any crazy eights?
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Your mom made a move on me.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Where did you learn that word?
Collins is a great man!
HARRY.
I didn't know that.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Nice jugs.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
...cause you said...
What?
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Who's your partner?
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Hey, where did you come from?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
But-
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Captain Rob came back?
A raft.
George Washington!
You're it.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Cute puppy.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
Well, I'm listening now.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
What? What did we do?
A float!
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
You take her.
Sorry, Charlie.
Why ith dat newth?
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
That's my boyfriend.
How much homework is there?
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Obviously.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
I am strong!
It's the big potato.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
You said "aloha" twice.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
You got the Extender?
What papers?
The evidence of what?
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
My Lord!
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Remove her gag!
He knows.
Run!
Are you a Fremen?
Will we see a worm?
Why do they come?
Liet?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
It burns.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Uh, beg to differ.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Really?
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Are you sure this is okay?
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Last night was quite a romp.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
Wow.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Will he be okay?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
You're a fuckin' mess.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Dolores, wait!
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Mr. Wood?!
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
I like to think so.
Mr. Reynolds!
I think you're quite handsome.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Can I help you?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
I got married last night.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Did you find it boring?
Oh.  Okay.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
I'm really sorry...
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
What the heck is THIS?!!
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
You think she really likes him?
You know what would be great?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
What did you study?
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Great line.
Leave her be.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Where are you going?
You said that.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
No. It's a mess.
How's Marcia? She all right?
I mean, that worked out.
Yes.
He had girlfriends!
She had white shoes.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
I'm at the hospital.
Who?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Ed! How did you know I was here?
I can't?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Are you asking me?
What does this mean?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Hey, Lou.
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Go!
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
I wish my stepfather was here.
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
There's a list.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Okay.
It's not their fault.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
Show business.
I'm making a tape.
I'm doing all right.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Hi.
You brought the girl!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Look, we gotta talk.
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
You know what your problem is?
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
I was in jail.
Hi.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Mm.
Ohhh...
Sign here, please.
By the X.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Looks good to me.
NO, that's fine
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
What a surprise.
Hmm?
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
And when did you do it?
Which door?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Hey Yeah?
Three twenty-five.
Yeah.  I'm here.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
But other people can see them too.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Who put you up to this?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Hell, good luck!
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
You dumbshit!
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
We talked.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Maybe.  I don't know.
What's through here?
Yeah, that's Stens.
What happened?
How's it going to look on your report?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Bud...
You wanted to meet here?
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
No.
That's right.
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
No.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
<u>No</u>.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
What are you going to do?
What's on the call sheet?
Lynn Bracken.
Really?  What did White say?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
I'll take your word for it.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
When?
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
Let my Susie rest in peace!
A sweet man.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
Not a word.
Have we met before?
Was it a party?
Really?  How?
What'd he say to you?
What'd he give to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You knew the deal. No contact.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
Okay.
I don't know what that means.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What if--
I'll pay you.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
I mean did you call anyone.
What'd I tell you?
I intercepted phone calls.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
What do you think?
They're here.
You're driving.
We lost 'em.
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Is it okay?
Very good.
What size?
I think she'll like this very much.
I know, but--
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Hey.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
What do you mean?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Sorry.
I've seen it.
Stacy, don't hang up.
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Brill?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
I know.
That's temporary.
Any idea what he looks like?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
What's his name?
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Sure, go ahead.
Dad!
Who won the fight?
What?
He's heard that it's escalated.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
I don't know!
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
Yeah.
We'd have to--
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
Yes sir.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Yes?
Now is that clear?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
You should come into the shelter.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
You sew very badly.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Why did you hold his collar?
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
I was talking about the girl.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Is this you?
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Or was it Toronto?
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
Yeah, for a while.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Oh.
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Are you asleep?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Excuse me -
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
Will you come with me?
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
And what if he really is a spy?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Yessir.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What are you talking about?
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
That's doable.
How about if I try humility.
Mr. MacDougal.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
I don't want to waste your time.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You have a car?
You disappeared.
Are you...okay?
I've got something...
I didn't expect you to be so...
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
We going somewhere?
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Fine. What do I do?
But--
He says they turned the card down.
What about your bags?
Those are my clothes.
I know it well.
I'll need that.
On what? Another job?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Aren't we early?
Aren't we all.
He wasn't.
You can't be too careful.
Ready?
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
What about the rules?
Peoples China Bank.
Got it.
That's where the Mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
No way to take another day or two?
So what are you going to do with your share?
The sign of our partnership.
Relax, don't jam it...
Hang on.
Put this on!
What's wrong.
Gin, really.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
The key to success is using the right tools.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
You look like George Washington.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
What's she doing here?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
There's more than one?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
What's chromium?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
Oh, my God.
Five million dollars?
I can put them in a good school.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
All I have is hundreds.
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You think there's more?
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
What do you mean?
Hey.  I like working with you.
I want my fucking money --
Is that what you want?
Counts?
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
And if you had to guess ...
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Morning!
Ho - ly - shit.
I wasn't gonna --
What is that?
When'd they file the demur?
And you were told to destroy those?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Which number do you want, George?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
More than you need me.
You already packed up your stuff?
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
I'm embarrassed.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
He can do it.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
I can't ...
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks a blue streak.
I'm looking for someone.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
That's right.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
What are you so grouchy about?
You, too, golden rod.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
Yes, Your Highness?
Not you?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
That was no earthquake.
They're moving away.
Stop that.
There's something out there!
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
You look silly.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Get out of here, Lando!
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
We've got to find Luke.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Leia!
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
But tell me why ...
Ben?  Ben?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
Yes, My Lord.
Did you call the Zoo?
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Do you have a name?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
What are they doing here?
We shall want a full autopsy ...
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
Ooww!
Give it to me.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
That's the deal.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Where do I put ashore?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Not you?
She's in the green.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Me too?
Aw, come on, Snake.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
Is he coming?
Good day to you, sir.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
At last...
Perceval, you have returned!
Whose son am I?
A king must marry, after all.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Guenevere...
Excalibur! Is it true?
Yes.
Father...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
Who is, then?
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Who does it serve?
Who?!
There are things about love--
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Very well. Climb up.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
It is.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
It's-
I'm sorry.
Hello?
And you got an invitation.
Dinner at the White House.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
Where do you want this?
It's serious?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Would you like some more coffee?
Oh, she'd love it.
Thank you.
But it's clean?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Bastard! I will kill you.
A man to see you.
Morning.
Is it coming out Willie?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Are you sure?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
You wouldn't.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Yes. He's already here.
What kind of stuff?
Where?
You've been playing with it?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
I don't want it.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Where'd you get it then?
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Goodnight Dims.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Withering Heights.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
Where's Regan?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I'm all right.
Is that too tight?
Save your servant
And also with you.
Amen.
What is it?
You're not my mother!!!
Have we met?
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
It's my goddamn car!
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Honey ...
What's wrong with them?
What do you do to him?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
What's the gig?
What's wrong with it?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Cindy.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
This time you gotta go.
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
What's with Charlie?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Nice, huh?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Get out of here!
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
You leaving that on?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
What?
Really.
The party's over.
A useless talent.
They were simple songs.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
What do you mean?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
What's it for?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
What?
Stay off it.
Fuck you.
Jack!
How're your hands?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
So what'd you think?
Actually, that's my stage name.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
So?
Ready?
It's orange!
Come on.  We don't have much time.
I wear a seven.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Right.
Jack, you with us?
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
You two could play checkers.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Great?
You're kidding me.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Some discussion.
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Brought it.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
All right.  Hold on.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
Forget it.
He do that every year?
Can't sleep?
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
How do you do it? Every night?
You're upset.
What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.
Nina?
Friend.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
The both of them?  In there?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Vegetables.
Let me get the light.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Jack.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
None?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Why would he need more?
Pollux ...
Thanks, Pollux.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
How is he?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Now what?
-- Castor?
What -- what are you doing?
Jamie ...
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
When did you start smoking?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Commander, what are you doing here?
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
I'm just having some fun.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
Just following your example.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
The hospital.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
-- what?
You're wearing your suit --
What's on your mind?
Her assistant?
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Adelle?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Why Jack?
Mr. Mintz.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
We’re almost done here...
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Where do I go now?
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Very nice. What is it?
We’re friends, aren’t we?
Damn...
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
She said that?
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
Got a minute, Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
What’s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
Are we finally being honest?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Where were you?
The city?  New York City?  Why?
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Here you go...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Uh...that baby’s crying...
How can you do that?
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
No?
You want the cake!?
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Jack.
Jack...can we afford all this?
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Annie goes to a great school.
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
Don’t do that...
You look great.
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
Not by a long shot.
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
Can I help you?
Last night was great...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
I mean...
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
I had it at four.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Are you alright?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
It's about to be a broken face.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Where...where am I?
Reed? ... Sue?
What's wrong with me?
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
About me?  How sweet.
What do you want, Vic?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
You're hot!
Sweet.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
What are you doing --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
Which was?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Okay to proceed.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
I know that. But what's the maximum?
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Wish I knew why.
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Yes, Alan.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
We can't take a second more.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
How does it look, Doctor?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
There it is!
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
Looks like somebody declared war.
I can't tell you.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
What is it, Skipper?
What's wrong, Skipper?
How's it look?
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Drop that fucking money!
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Unguent.
Clear him off the road.
She started shrieking, you know.
One of us pays the other for half.
Huh?
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's right. And we need more money.
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Yah.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
... I'm sorry, sir?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah!
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Twice.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Stan and I're okay.
We're good to loan in.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
You're darned tootin'!
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, I just -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Hiya, Lou.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
How's it look, Marge?
Yah?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
...This is a nice place.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
...Well, yah. Who's this?
...So?
It's just the three cent.
Uh-huh.
Oh, my.
I'm tellin' ya.
The first rule of Project --
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
You are a moron.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
Is that your blood?
Hmm?
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You're kidding.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
That's the idea -- we split them.
Look, this is a bad time...
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
No, thanks.
You feel nothing?
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
Marla...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Why are you doing this?
Hello?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
What do you do, Tyler?
I mean -- for a living.
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
I guess so.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Insurance'll cover it.
Well, I have to file a claim...
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Yeah.
Huh?
Can I stay at your place?
What?
They're called "cigarette burns."
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't know about this.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Unbelievable, huh?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Promise you won't.
Promise?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
We don't need him...
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
What are we doing?
Tyler...
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
I don't know!  Nothing!
This conversation...
Four in Milwaukee.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think anything?
...stop me?
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
You want out?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Robert Paulson?
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Really?
Would you rather be dead?
What list?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
Please, what else could it mean?
Six duds in a row.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Another premonition?
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
I'm not sure I understand.
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Whoa, nine months?
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
What on Earth are they doing?
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Remember the departure time?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Can't you open the door?!
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Knock it off!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Again.
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
What do you call that?
Batteries not included.
What's this?
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
What's she saying?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
You never been in one of those things.
Are you okay?
I do?
Invulnerable.
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
What was that?
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
How long have you been setting up?
How long before you're fully on line?
It's not necessary.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Hello, John.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Yep! Right on it!
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
He's not a moron.
See, I told you!
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Parry?
What if I was a relative?
Can I help you?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Hello Lydia?
Your name was picked.
A list.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Oh, Lydia!
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Have I died?
The Little...
Him...?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Do you follow her every day?
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Happily married, probably.
Beautiful night huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
Well, it's enough for me.
I never say anything I have to.
I don't drink coffee...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
No, I...
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
What?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
You're depressed that I come along.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Bobby...
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
Well...
Tea.
Oh.
No.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Daddy's very ill.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
Yeah... I guess so...
It's not that bad.
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
I think he's got a terrific personality.
You're leaving?
But what about me?
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
No, don't do that...
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
Robert?
I have to talk to you.
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Mass production is what does it.
Pardon me?
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
If you want to call it that.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Who are you?
Wussup?
A play-ya.
Come down!
Eddie from Compost?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
What are you going that way for?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
A bad attitude.
Yo, that's my girl.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Probably.  One of the many.
No.
Would you like me to change anything?
That's what he said.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch!
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Ask anybody.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
So where do you know Alan from?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Right.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
No idea at all?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Thought so. What for?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Oh my God!
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
You should have proved that in a court of law.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Then he has.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Alan Stanwyk.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I'm still here.
A .357.
Do you have a passport?
Will you kill me?
'Magic' today, huh?
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
My hero.
Cute young thing, too.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
That's a strange combination.
Hi.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Are you still in love with Alan?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Who.
What are you talking about?
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
I would, actually.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Muchas gracias.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
So you're saying she moved out.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Who?
Just give me a hint, all right?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
No, I ain't got you...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Did she tell you anything?
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
How'd you get this from her?
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
I don't know, what was the case?
Hello, Ford...
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Hello?
Let's get serious...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Ick.
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Ouch.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Two words.  Disco Express.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
It doesn't have to be like this?
What about Don?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
How nice.
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Got a wife named Angie.
I don't...
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Did you pick up the car?
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Il est en retard.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
We must follow it.
What's your story?
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Why not?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Yeah.
What are you saying?
No, I don't.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You okay, man?
Frank...what's wrong?
You give him his drops?
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Frank, we need to talk...
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Where are you transmitting from?
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
You call your son Little Chief?
What'd you say your name was?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell...
How could this be happening?
You sound...ground up...?
It's really you, isn't it?
No wait, don't go!
Why?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
When?
Dad...?
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
When?
Murdered?  Why?
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
He took your wallet?
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
How you feeling?
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Wife around?
Hell-
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
Breakfast?
It's dark down there.
What's the matter?!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
A hammock?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
I don't know.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What happened that night?
You know him?
Faster!  Eat faster!
See anything?
I don't see anything.
This is no time to celebrate!
What're you doing?
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Ahh, nothing.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
Jason who?
But, Dad, we...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
Why?
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
But what if they try and scare us?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
He didn't say anything?
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Look --
Steven buggin' you?
That's very colorful, chief.
What are you doing?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Don't do anything stupid.
I know what it sounds like.
About Jessica.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Time to check out the waiters.
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
You have no right...
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
What are you doing??
What a beautiful day.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Everything okay?
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
So, are you having fun yet?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
I...I don't know...
Yes...
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
You have to call the police...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
Elliot?
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
What?
Shoot him.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
How do you Eknow.
Of course I saw it.
Let's work on it.
Does it feel comfortable?
She died.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Do you want to get some coffee?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
What else?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
See, Daddy.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I'll have whatever she's having.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Alma Wetzel.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Life is good.
Who is it?
What do you want?
We must have been heroic.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Because life is good.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
Yes.
What's good?
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
Is it true?
He's a very sweet man.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
Yes.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
You're a clergyman.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
You're an ambitious man.
You've done me a great service.
You mean a general strike?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Perhaps some tea?
You're an extraordinary man.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
You almost sound like you believe that.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
No?  What's keeping you?
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
From what budget?
What are you waiting for?
Surely you know what you have.
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Good to see you're feeling better.
You okay, Jerome?
Suit yourself.
German.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
It's not too late to back out.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
That's not the point.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
Call German.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
I have your samples ready.
Why have you done this?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Yeah.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Hugo!  I've found him!
No bother.
Why don't we say we were together?
Does it have a name?
So you didn't do it after all.
What happened?
A year is a long time.
That's your problem.
What do you add up to here?
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
Where did you get them developed?
What do you want for dinner?
I guess I'm kind of...
Promise you won't laugh.
What about the bank?
They checked in.
Do you trust him?
When we had trouble before it was different.
There may be a hunting party.
What?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Yeah.
Come on, come on.
I don't know, airport I guess.
What now?
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Suit yourself.
Two.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
How's Mama and the kids?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
How was that?
Let's just get to the border.
Which way?
You got it.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
I've got to stop.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
You knew what I'd do.
What about the brakes?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Confidential, like.
Who paid you to see me off?
Address?
I want to talk to you later.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Who's setting you up in this place?
Is he coming here?
That's why you waited for me.
Thanks for coming.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
I'm staying with a friend.
Is he staying the night?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
Now just a minute...
What about Keith?
So shut up.
Did you sleep well?
No chance of that.
Is he?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Oh, you've been watching television.
Eh? Have a drink.
Ask me?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
What's that?
Four hundred?
Deadbeats all.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
And it's not right to the customers.
That's right?
No.  That's absolutely right.
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
You...
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
How do you know he'd buy them?
You haven't talked to him.
We're just "talking" about it.
Did I say that?
A buck a shot.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
He'd give me a job.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
What?  What?  The leads.
And why is that?
I, you know, they should be insured.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.  They are old.
He said he filed...
They stole...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Were the leads...
A waste of time?  Why?
They aren't?
Where were you?
Will you excuse...
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
That's great.
...how can you talk to me that... that...
What?
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Would you excuse us, please...?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Would you come in here, please?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
Shelly...
Under him?
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I will close.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
What happened?
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
What are you trying to tell me?
How do you know I made it up?
It was his idea.
I...
Abso...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Don't.
You did that?
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
Eight units?
Fuck you care...?
Fuck her...
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
I wanted to speak with you about...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I'm sorry...?
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
Who did she call?
What would have elapsed?
I told you.
No.  She told me "right now."
What...?  Say the words.
The deal.
You cashed the check?
Guess what the Machine did?
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
What is this, your farewell speech?
You closed him yesterday.
It went down.  I filed it.
Yes.
Aren't you going out today?
I have the stuff from last year's...
Are you alright?
Do you like them?
On your pillow.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Yes, thank you.
Bought at the airport.
He is weak.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
We were all upset about that.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh, 'scuse me.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
That's off now.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Mikey, I hoped...
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
They are everywhere!
Fifteen percent skim?
You're right.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
I'm going to the market.
How's the baby?
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
Where?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
Why too late?
His brother came to help him.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
Kay, I told you...
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
You said you were Klingman.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
However I can help you...
Enjoy.
This doubles my investment.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Says who?
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Are we going to eat or what?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
What're you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
And your name is --?
Or would you prefer a beer?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
I never thought you were.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Why not?
Ah.  A philosopher.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
This was World War I?
What was that about?
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Is that --?
I never made it to Korea.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
Do you mind?
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
I don't know.
Just take off the fucking mask!
Did I hurt you?
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
Then take the pills.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
You didn't?
How's the leg?
What about?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
I know you --
You want to come along quiet?
You have my word...
I know you.
And this has what to do with me?
Not my girl anymore
I know you.
I'll catch you later, Randall --
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
How'd it go?
It just ain't happening --
okay ...
Diane 1.
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
You guys have any skills at all?
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
You look good...
Why didn't you tell me?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
Any more, O -- ?
You goin' home?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
So what are you gonna do?
You?
You hear me?
Shadow games ...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
You okay -- ?
Come here -
You want me to buy her?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
Let me worry about The Club ...
Where to -- ?
What are you doing... ?
What -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
Some crew you got ...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
What do you want, shithead?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
I warned you a million times.
What do you do?
My bag. My bag.
The bag with the envelopes.
I'm gonna need some money.
I don't care. Something's going on.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Stop! Stop!
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
Where'd you find such creeps?
I gotta go home.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Stay there.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He didn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
She didn't do it again did she?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Oh...
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
I guess so.
Okay.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
How much money you got?
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
Will you take a check?
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
What is it?
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
What's that?
--that?--
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Get out, Will.
No.
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
So who won the bet?
Good to see you.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
My kind of background?
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Seems like it's going well.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Do you know when you'll be back?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
Well, she out did herself today...
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
What?
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Why not?
My wife's dead.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Don't give me you line of shit.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
What?
Yes.
I just want you to know, Sean...
I'll keep in touch.
No. Thank you.
See ya.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
No I haven't...
No I wasn't...
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
Where have you been?
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
When?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Then what are you afraid of?
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Lots must a died, too.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
Kinda pie y'got?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
So long.
Want to work?
That's not your affair. Name.
Kids?
Government.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Been out travelin' around?
And you ain't ashamed?
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Goin' far?
You ain't got to get sore.
I didn't mean nothing.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
How 'bout Granma?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
But will it--hurt the baby?
I like the tent better.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
How 'bout it?
Ma, you sick?
When?
I ain't full.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
They know he got hit in the face.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Well?
You mean get off my own land?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
Here we go!
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
But what about this?
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
What's this?
You people looking for work?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Yes, sir.
You don't...
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Remember high school?
I want to be an actor.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Jesus...
So you eat-- read it everyday?
I just play my own collection.
Tell me about yourself.
Are you going to the reunion?
It's always the little things.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Seven it is.
Hello...?
Do you want to get a drink first?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
What if I come back?
How do you know?
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Like a union?
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
In Detroit. This weekend.
I bought a new rug.
What's a revival tent?
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Of course you will.
So what happened to you?
Debi's house.
How's that?
I'm a professional killer.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Doesn't matter.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
The answer's no.
Why didn't it work out?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Show me again.
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
No, you didn't.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I don't believe this!
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
What did you say?
How's everything?
David?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
You've already made arrangements!?
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
Yes?
No. I am a "tubab."
Was the trip okay?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
They fired you?
Frank's a good man.
What?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Mixed salad.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
When you figure on branding?
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
What does she do?
Sure?
"... and I said that"...
Don't be such a baby!
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
She's rabid, but cute.
What's that?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
What?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Damn!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
I want it to have my children!
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Yeah?
And what's he do?
What are you doing?
Up all night again, huh?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Talk to me.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Name your stakes.
Make it our first date.
We need your help.
Shit!!
Alright, so what have we got?
You look good in a dress.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Uhhhmm...
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Good.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Yo, what's up?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Phreak?
You think they're going to bust us?
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
What number please?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
When did you find this out?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Are you two okay?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Found it.
Why wasn't I notified?
Why shouldn't I?
Now where are you going?
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Who you calling?
What the hell did this?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie!
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Do you?
You look sharp. You understand?
I am. Ben Meeker.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Okay.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
You're going to be late!
Well, are we still on for tonight?
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
Shit!
Hello?
Annie, was that you?
Lies.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Yes, you can.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
You locked yourself in.
I wonder where they went.
Go get me a beer.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Ten minutes.
Anybody live here?
A man wouldn't do that...
Exactly what do you need?
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
What about the bogyman?
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There WAS.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
I'm scared!
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Yes, she is.
She's washing her clothes.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
PROBABLY going.
Pull up to the entrance!
What did he say?
...any sister talk?
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Oh, yeah.
Wow, it's the red one?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Hmm?
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
It's really sad.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Like, uh...?
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No!  No...
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got like six gold records.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
I was looking for you.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
This is not an easy situation.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
She has all the cooking talent.
Where're you going?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Oh, Mom!
Want some coffee or tea?
Hmm?
Why?
Oh, yes, you have!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
You're just realizing this now?
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
Oh, great.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Go right over there.
Gee.
This is the second opinion.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
You promised to stay on the wagon.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
What?  You're kidding!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Oh, he's such a loser!
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Yeah, can you believe it?
I know, no--  I know.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Boy--
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Good.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Thanks for a swell time.
I was so bored!
God!
Yes, you do recall, right?
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Well...
You're kidding me.
You're okay, though, huh?
Really?
Really?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Right.
Oh!
Oh, God!
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Hi.  How you doin'?
Tch.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Yeah.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Aren't you glad to see me?
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
...very good.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
You want to get married...?
You're ready now.
How crazy is that.
What, What, I can't hear you...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
...are they hard to get?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
I like Popcorn...
You give me whatever I want...?
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
What reaction?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
He is...?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Sir:
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Yes sir, I saw it. 
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Waal...
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
...yes.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
If your duty requires it.
And?  Then?
Darling...
...long overdue.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
Yes.... yes...
Make them eat the figurine.
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
What's that, Baby?
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
...what...?
Give me your gun...
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
I don't understand.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
...my love...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Ask me when we get home.
I know where he is.
I know where he is.
I want the money.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
Yes.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
No.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Man, she's losing it...
Talia, don't go!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
...sorry...
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
What in the hell did you do that for?
Yeah. I guess I do.
Do you really not believe in God?
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Kurt doesn't look too good.
You can be so immature!
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
How do you turn the fucker off?
Answer him dick!
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
You two....
How was the funeral?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
Hello!
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
What does old Stew want?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I'm so happy to see you!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Hello!
Oh-what a nice outfit!
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Mummy!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Let's go overseas . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I'm coming with you.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Skin cancer.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Sure plenty of times.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
I understand... I won't-
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Must be nice.
I have my connections
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret... what the fuck...?
Have we met?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
You're alive...
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Wait... what the hell is this...
You okay?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
You got a drinking problem or what?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
The bathroom!  For two days?
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
Turn that thing off.
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
You were... very... inspiring.
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
What's the matter?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
She wants to quit?
He lost a shoe!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Reporters don't have hormones?
I didn't ask him.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Where are these toys of yours?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
I should.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Do you do washing machines, too?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
A man?  Was it a dream?
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Have you just plain asked him?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Whew.
Where'd he go?
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
But it's what we want.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
Did you hear what he said?
I hear things in this house,
How long does it have to be a new house?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
The cab's waiting!
He wants to see me!
That's not the case.
God, your sister's really hot.
Are we gonna buy this house?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Is it a king or a queen?
I'd like that.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Tough.
This ties in with Nash.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Where were you last night around nine?
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
The river.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
Thank you, Thomas.
As friends -- always as friends.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
What are we doing here?
I'll go first.
You can go first.
How comes it your are not afraid?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Sometimes.
Do you love me, Conner?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
If it's good advice.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know.
No.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Be careful, Conner.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
Is there anything else you need?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
I guess not.
Jen?  Are you all right?
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Jesus.  What is this?
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
There is no way out.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
You with the cops?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
We're cool.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
That you, Talley?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Give up.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
We can take it with us.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Donuts here any good?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
All right.  Now the second one.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
What do you want?
What's going on?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
What's wrong with the radio?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's mine.  Talley.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I think so.
He has lots of disks.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Paul!
Excuse me?
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
You want to pay me?
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
What is it?
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
He did.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Where are my supplies?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Where are they going?
When?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Let's go.
Mr. Manager.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Where are we going, sir?
Are you sure this is the river road?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
You are the manager?
What do you want?
You have our cards.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
Was there blood?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I will need a suite.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Thomas wants advice?
You could have asked for a favor.
The president has been murdered.
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Paul, don't let them die.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Any luck?
They are being evacuated.
You could leave, Paul.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
What's the matter?
I have to go out to get food.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
I had you transferred to Kigali.
A car.
What does it matter.
Let me go. Children get off.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Oh, my babies.
Can I have your name again?
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
That is why they call it coach?
What is this about no water?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
'Less the place really is haunted.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Uhhhh...
If you know where it is, get there!
I'll meet you down there.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Thanks.
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- you lose either way, Price --
What --
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
What are you talking about?
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
I was in the middle of --
You think this is fucking funny??
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
First time for everything.
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Please! I need your help.
There is something very not normal going on here!
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Pritchett: what is going on?
Did you find something?
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
Town records are coming up now.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Don't play games with me, little girl.
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
What about all my other stuff?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Can I have this room daddy?
What's he doing daddy?
Are we going back to California daddy?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
What's the matter?
God rest her soul.
But do you agree with me?
A friend?
We don't know.
You must be a Londrigan.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
This isn't happening...
What's going to happen?
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
There's something in there.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
Why are you so interested?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
How have you ... ?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Sure.  Why?
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Yes really.
But you gave me a rose ...
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
Joey?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
I miss you too.
Yeah right.  Look ...
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
The security's actually not that severe.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Cameras?
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
We're going in from the ground floor.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
My life is not some deal.  I...
How.
Anna, what are you trying to say...
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
I wanna know...
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
No, let me!
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
This is the worst night...
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Why does this have to be so hard...
Something short.
Snappy.
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Cigarette?
...You know! For kids!
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Smitty.
Sid found me the icepack.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
...You do?
...The people look like ants.
For Pete's sake, Norville!
You mean you know about this?
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Muncie.
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Ya know, entry level!
I got big ideas, though!
Terrific.
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...It is?
But, Buzz --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Geez, I --
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
...He's not noticing, Benny.
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
She's good, Bennie.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
I'd love to.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
Mrs. Rand.
Does she suffer?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
-- But, you're an American?
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
But don't you have to work?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
It is not beautiful.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
Well?
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
You want that?
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
Wesley!
I don't know -- I don't know--
An accident at the mill?
In other words, I'm on trial.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Good night.
I... I think I am...
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
I have no idea.
You've...
This just isn't the best moment for this.
I'll drive you --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Grades?
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
A prior engagement overcame me.
Good-night dad.
What you been up to?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Your toes cold?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Good shit.
It's what?
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I suppose. Why?
Oh.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Here you are.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Where you going?
Flame on, asshole.
Huh?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
I do.
Truly? Do speak.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Where you going?
Want some gum?
You have to follow me?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Wow!
Charles.
Hood residence.
And?
Hey Wendy.
All my model planes.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Good.
Just after Leland Street.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
How much closer would you say you were?
Duggar called him?
It's legitimate.
Thanks.
He would have liked that.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
No.
You know my plan of action.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
I'm not expecting anyone.
Did you love her?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
I was her best friend.
You want me to take you somewhere?
I don't know.
It was like some big fucking secret!
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
She used some stupid code name.
I'm sorry?
I suppose.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
You're not following procedure.
Wild card.
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
But why?
Then blame the one who made her...
We want no quarrel with him.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Are these not the answers you came for?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Why does he call you that?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
You both did it?
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
This is no performance.
This is monstrous!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You want death? Is it death you want?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Come, you're going to feed now.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
We belong in hell.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Unless I make her one of us...
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
But why did you tell her?
You promise to care for her then?
Yes.
And the child who did die?
You're in 201 and 202.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Storm season?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Say yes.
That could break the machine.
Okay, okay. You're right.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Oh, god, it's you --
Ray...what are you doing?
The shower again?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
There was a body! I swear it!
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Pretty cool bar.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
He leave you?
Cool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
Take this.
They were cut loose.
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
Where is Miss Wollsten?
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Do you mind if I go with you?
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
It makes me fear her.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Well, tell, him.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Stand back.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Oh, no.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
By letting me help you.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What?
You know where he lives?
Poor George . . . Sit down.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
What's that?
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Is this the place?
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Today, over at the house.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
It will?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
Uh-huh.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Oh . . .
Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Is it a charge, sir?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Oh, it's wonderful.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Hey, George . . .
No, George, don't . . .
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Some other time, George.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Pop!
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
I'm not very good at this.
Eighteen.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, George, George, George.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Great!  Find one for me.
My hair's getting wet!
It's okay, it's okay....
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Your dad must be really pissed.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
I don't know.
Want to talk about it?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
What is it?  What's there?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Untie that rope.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Because.
Mike?  Is that you?
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Where the hell were you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Let's get the kid home.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Nothing.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Because of today?  The beach?
I know you did....
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
We're alone.
Are you serious?
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Hi Dad.
Terry!  You okay?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
What about the others?
What're we going to do in the mean time?
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Hurry, please.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
How much longer?
About damn time.
You do everything your parents tell you?
I thought you were grounded.
I don't care.
What's wrong?
Heading back?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Not tonight.
Who wouldn't.
They're turning around.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Yeah.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Wave to my son.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
We're ready for you.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
It hasn't adjusted.
Don't feel bad.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
You're going down there again?
Change your mind?
I can use a shot of what he's got.
Mmmm... you smell good.
No, we'll go through here.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
What do you mean, we don't?
Come on!
How is he?
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
Are you okay?
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
I can have them walk backwards.
I told you, something's upset them.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
I will.
I want that shark alive.
I like it when they wake up.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
How come?
Besides that.
Take it up.
The space shuttle has landed!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Did you see that?
Make sure you put this back.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
No, South Georgia.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
How far away is filter number four?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Come on, sweetheart....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
It sure is good to be home....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
They won't kill it....
Stop that....
Are you all right?
A big one....
In a minute....
I like Grandma's cooking....
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I didn't mean to start that....
How are you doing?
You're having a good time....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
No....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
Depends on where you want to go....
What are you doing?
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
I could take some time off....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I borrow it without telling him....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
I hope she's a good sailor....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Grab your socks....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
Money is money....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
When I got the grant.....
When I invited you...
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
How long have you known Hoagie?
How come only me?
You told me what?
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Who grows more beautiful....
Woman has taste....
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Did you bring it with you?
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
What about that kid, Ross?
Not for me ..
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
There's nothing in the files?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
You gotta stop smoking ..
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
We're going.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
Why's she blind, Bro?
She wasn't lying about the van.
Sure.
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Where's your watch?
What if we need a back up?
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
What is that?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Have you got a print from the hand?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
Did he get you the job?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
I know what a "witness" is.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
Me?
What color was it?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Why?
You got a warrant for this?
Who sought the warrant?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
He's happy, darlin ..
You want something, darling?
You can drive down there, Sir ..
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
This can't be happening to me.
I just heard.
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Listen to me!
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Can I help?
Now what did you lose?
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
That took guts.
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
What --
If I said that, would you stay?
Forgot your keys --
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Oh, thank you.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
You love me now, don't you?
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
What's wrong.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
You don't want to go home, do you?
I'm asking you a question --
Not everyone has what you have.
Jerry!  You made it --
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
You gonna get that --
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
I'm fine.  What's up?
Pardon me?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
You wanted smaller.
One-two-three, swing.
Hi.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I won't tell.
What's going on, Jerry?
ERRR-IIIC!
Oh, my God.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
You hate to swim.
What?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
He could have died.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
How was your trip? Profitable?
Absolutely not.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
Is it a rex?
They never got that big.
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
You remember the sounds they made?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
How much of this island have you explored?
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Sorry.  We were saying?
Any damage?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
I'm not going, John.
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Is that kid still bothering you?
I could come with you.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
What kind of gun is that?
What is?
It's... behind... us.
You version of it.
What's he got in there?
She's gutty.
No way.
Then this is our chance.
There' no reason for name calling.
?!
Come on!
Something's wrong.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
Can you set up?
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
These formations.  They're dried --
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
WHAT ARE YOU-
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
How many lines of code are there?
Pretty sure.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Okay, who's the jerk?
The movement!
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Oh, shit.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
Are you sure?
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie, com one!!
Do you see anything?
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
Alan?
Dino droppings?
Faster, faster!
Yes?
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Tim!  Lex!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
I like cows.
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I hate trees!
Hello?
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
That's not true...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Mister Biller?
I think we're lost.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Two.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
It's still on.
Three.  Where's my client?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
He wets the bed?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
Oh?
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Uh-huh...
See this?
Add it to the list.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
What are you doing?
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
What's that?
Ten minutes...
We're down to seven minutes.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Have you worked here long?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
Just what you've published.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
It's my last and final one.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Did you see him?
You wanted to see me, sir.
-- Eduard --
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
What?
What's funny?
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Gabriela ...?
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Probably not.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
There's a light up ahead.
Jack!
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
I do not love him.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Yes indeed.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
What about?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Well do you think it was him?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Is there anything more I could --
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
I called Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
You must be discouraged.
That who?
What?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
Have you discussed this with them?
Not unusual.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Think this is our guy?
Are you closing the case?
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Where is the child?
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Mom, I mean dad...
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Then eat around it.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
See you in the morning light.
Wow!
Is this really your desk?
Did mommy ever see this?
Are you going to get remarried?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Did you wish to?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
A heavy drinker?
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Only can I still see him?
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
What?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
Oh, Christ!
What if I fight it?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
Mr. Kramer, there's--
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
We must go, Holiness.
I worry about them.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
Not the way to talk to people.
No.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Yes.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
America, we shall see.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Me?
Do you think I must?
What does the butter spot feel like?
It is a story, you decide.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
Am I running away?
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Tell me.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Hmm.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
I might get a shot.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
Around here.  Yeah.
We are here on official business.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I'm laying a spring trap!
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Is this a trick?
His head was just... bitten off.
This is a setback.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
No!
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
Where is he?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
Eh.  Fuck it.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
It's too dangerous for--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Okay.  We're up at six.
He thinks they're what?
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
No thanks.
I'm not mushing it.
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
We might as well pack.
He's mooing.
Get him onto shore.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
I'm ready when you are.
You said nobody came in here!
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Not yet.
You have a thing against museums?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
With what?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
They're coming right in.
Did you get him?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
I'm not even a field person.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
What'd I do?
Boy, is that smart...
No. He won't come after me.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Why not?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
What would it take?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
Five... so far.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
By the book, he's a sadist.
They all were.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
The death of my father.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Two months.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
So you ran away...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
What...?
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Are you alright?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
Much further?
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Will you go back to England?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
What?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
You still have an aversion to the water?
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
And if we're unlucky?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
What happened to you?
What a place for them...
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
Sergeant Major!
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
What is enough?
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
The honors of war?
Qui vive?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
What's wrong?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
I thought they were your friends?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Where the hell've you been?
That was a loud one wasn't it?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
We made it!
It hit me!  Where are they?!
What's wrong with it?
I'm going inside.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Okay, number 23's full.
Thank you, Martin.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Forty-eight hours!
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
If he had his blinkers on--
What the?...
What happened?
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
What's going on?
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Getting some food.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Clear for pickup.
What is it?
How is he?
It needs blood?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Don't spend all day down there.
Are you sure you saw something?
I'll kill him!
I wanted to talk to you about that.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
There are no others.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Son?
What are you doing?
It's not him, Dad.
What can I do for you?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Dog, I have found the cash!
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
I hope this is the right move.
Well, what did he say?
Tom, this is our case.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
I will.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
What are you doing, Plank?
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Look. Go on, look.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
That isn't true.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Do whatever they tell you--
Why don't you start with that?
So you knew this young man before?
You're dismissed.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
How's business?
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Just wondering.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
You still going to all the home games?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
No. You?
Hey, it's the General.
Uncle Al--
Same as they done in Mexico.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
I got a pretty good guess.
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Dad--?
I have a B average.
Are we going to ever see your father?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Cliff--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Treasure hunter?
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
You get much of that in here?
So.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Eladio Cruz.
Reputation?
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
This girl is a friend of yours?
I thought you were married!
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Your mother was a saint.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
That's a matter of interpretation--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
That so?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
I haven't been out here for a while.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
Bledso
Besides my father, I mean.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Why would I want to go there?
Right. When he was killed.
Nobody's too busy.
Thank you.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
No. Is he sick?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
You got in late last night.
It was for personal consumption.
Got him here?
You don't want to be Sheriff.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Yeah?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You think we need a new jail?
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Nix.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
Take a look at this.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
How'd you spell that again?
Who did this?
Please.
If you've lied to me to me --
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
He's with us...
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Sorry.  You asked.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
How did it go today?
They were jealous of him.
Yes.
No!  No!  No!
Don't look.
What the fuck?
Valentin?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
And this Butterfield guy--
You believe that?
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Philip Swann?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Who is she?
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Harry D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Oh Jeez.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
They got here before us.
That's where we're all going.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
He did something with the ground.
Can you do it?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
One question.
Maybe... I... don't...
Why's that?
Nix! Nix!
Yes! Yes!
And?
What about you? Why are you here?
What did you study?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
Of course.
No, its easy.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
It's for my daughter.
What happened to your toe?
You think so?
When are you leaving?
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Harris?
My stockings.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
I don't know.
You know, eat healthier.
What?
Yeah.
When are you coming home?
Hospital?
Hello? Yes?
How'd it go today?
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
I missed you.
You never said anything to me...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
She's been stalking you, Peter.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
You'll do it?
What is it?
You raised me, like a son.
You killed my parents.
Why are you doing this to me?
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Yes... and you are?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
What?!?!
Trick him.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
There's nothing else here.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You know what?  You can go.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
What's the matter with you?
Thanks again for everything.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
I hate it.
That's not funny
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Whatever.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Okay.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
I can take it.
Can I take your coat?
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
I found you someone.
And he's fine, girl.
They ever love you back?
I know.  But chances are...
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
Thanks, Sidra.
You were trying to make me look bad.
I know.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
Your Dad play?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
You do act different.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
What do I have to do?
I think we gotta kiss now.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
You don't look half-bad.
Early night for you, isn't it?
You finish the reading for E-con?
What'd it say?
Forget Tonya Randall.
That was so weak.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Hey.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
You forgot to be there.
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
What are the doctors saying?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Cause I don't get it.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
What?
Quincy, please...
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Why not?
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Why?
What's Mom think?
From your mouth.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
What kind of Cancer?
Oh, she's fine.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
...Hello...?
...yeah...
Yeah, but I don't know --
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Yeah.
The gentleman who came to the door --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Ok, ok. I'm back.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
This is my job.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Please, yes.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Eight o'clock?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Billingsley's?
Why not?
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
Yeah.
I lost my gun.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
No, what's wrong?
What's your name?
-- can I get you?
-- what kind?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I'm almost done.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
What?  What does that mean?
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
I'm sick.
I paid you back.
What is that?
I've been a good worker --
Yeah.
How's today then?
Get a girlfriend.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Do me a personal favor --
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
No.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
All it takes is one second?
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
I would just want to clear some things up:
This isn't meant --
It's all important --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Where does that name come from?
Uh. huh.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
What the hell is this Marcie?
...you know...
No.
Yeah. Yes.
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
You want her right now?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Willa Cather.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
What were you saying, Stanley?
How you doing?
No.  No.
I love you so much.
I think that you know.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
No.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Where will the money go?
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Ok.
Yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
You coulda been in front --
You ready to keep winning?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
Hi.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
M'lady...?
God smiled upon us.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
My Queen...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
What is it, mother?
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
No!  Stop --
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
Coming?
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
D'Artagnan, unready?
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Die?  What...?
Where are you going?
Recent hours have been a shock.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
What number, on the first page?
You've... memorized...?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Magnificent valor...
Sire!  I -- How did you --
... Nothing.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Shall I leave?
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Captain Doyle?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Every step of the way.
It's Marvosa -
Bullshit...
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Zydowski.  It's about time.
Something I don't already know?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Captain?
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
What's going on here?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
What?
Jesus, man...
No...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Oh man...what happened?
You must be going somewhere.
You don't seem afraid of much.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
What about him?
It was you who did the asking.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Where?
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
For Christ's sake, why?
Is it weird?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
What'd it say?
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
When are you coming back?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Where the hell's Graham!
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Ride with me.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
That was nice of you to think of that.
No. Reba...?
I'll see you later. All right?
Who is it?
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Do you feel privileged?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Yes?
Do you have it?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
I want to see Lecktor now.
Can you read it to me?
Linda King's desk.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Do you remember what you said?
What will you do?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
What's this Mama shit?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Meet point's up ahead!
Lt. Fisk said...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
How?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Why should I tell you?
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
No.
Why does it feel good?
Andy?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
What was that all about?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Cue the commercial!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why Memphis?
Hey Andy, good show.
So?  What do they know?
Give me the book.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
I was very original!
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
"Philosophically"?
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
Is he in his room?
Sure...
They are dead.  In either case --
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
You got the money?
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Do you?
You don't, do you?
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
No, it's all right.
Is that...?
Do you always look at it encoded?
Why you're here?
Five.  Since I've been here.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Yes.
All right --
What is he doing?
No!  It's too far away.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Why do my eyes hurt?
This isn't real?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
How did I beat you?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
We need an exit.
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
My name is Trinity.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
God...
What did she tell you?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What are you doing?
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Are you all right?
It's a city?
Holy shit!
What are they doing to him?
How?
We need an exit!
Cypher, I thought --
Tank, you're hurt.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
What just happened?
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
No.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Nervous?
You flew before?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Next time, bet with your own kind.
You got some mouth!
Nah.
Don't come any closer!!!
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Keep your mouth shut.
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
Nope...
Disgraceful.
Oh Michael, look...
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
Charlie, this is business.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
Diane, how are you feeling?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
No.
Bore.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Must have been all the liquor in him.
How much?
That's your name?
Did you speak to the Governor?
Just plain 'Joe'?
Daddy!
Have you got a minute?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
From the Korean War.
I don't like cake.
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Yeah, but --
...This shit's not bad.
And that?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
...See you tomorrow night.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Drew, you're out of line.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Thank you for coming.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
I'm not stepping anywhere --
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
It's going to be great --
No.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
He said that?
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
No, I come to see Doctor.
Don' need you okayin'.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Jennifer.
Oh yes, I do.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
'Big'?
I've got plenty of friends.
Yes --?
Goodnight, Joe.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
'To bed'?
I love your smell.
Thank you.
-- Could you?
Yes?
...No.
More than you love peanut butter?
Well -- I --
What will we do?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
That's it?
No --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
How long have I got?
How are you?  How're you feeling?
A 'deal'?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Are you going to eat your lunch
Truly - uh - splendid.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Okay.  Goodnight.
What's okay?
I couldn't sleep.
'Spooning'?
Uh --
Which is what?
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Not exactly.
You are --?
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
I think you know --
Please.  Talk to me --
The 'question' --
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
We're all here, Bill --
I hope so.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Thank God.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
What?!
It'll come back, Daddy.
That was wonderful.
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Nothing.
You don't know anything about Joe --
But what?
Nothing lasts.
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
Why?
79.
Hiya.
Burt.
You don't know?
No, let's go.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
Jimmy?
They treating you alright?
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
His name was Jimmy.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Why would you do that?
What's wrong?
I'm not.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
You tell me.
You're the memory guy?
My boyfriend told me about you.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I'm not appealing the decision.
This is your car.
What the hell you want to go there for?
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
Why?
You're living.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Unfinished business.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
She has no idea who I am.
Envelopes?							    *
How do you know this?
How do you know him?
You're not coming?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
You won't remember!
So who are you saying he was?					*
You probably.							 *
Your name's Teddy.
Bullshit.							*
* Thank you.							    *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
And...?
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
We're not certain...
I got the item.
We want it back.
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Where's that?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Were you born in Havana?
Your father?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
I forgot the napkins.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Would you find me...?
Where would I go?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
...in the morning.
Red light, green light, José?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
What friend?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
How much we looking for?
I am asking.  You to me.
What's your take?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
From whom...?
Out of...?
How'd they get onto you?
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
So?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
And...?
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
This the load you lost a while back?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
The Statue of Liberty.
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You sure you heard what I said?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
You ain't coming to work?
I can tell, can't you?
He's got taxi fare.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Forget it.
What's in your socks?
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
They wrong?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
These guys're good drivers.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
You want me to leave?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
It's there!
Want me to take over?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Where'd you get that limp?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
No, I'm not afraid.
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Got a family back there?
Girlfriend?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
And you?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
What's wrong?
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
You got your stuff?
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
Why the suit?
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
What lawyer?
Lady...
What?
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Can we get this car there?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
What do you-?
What are you doing down here?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Oh, no, you were-
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Don't.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
It worked before...
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
No...
It bit you.
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
What's your new book called?
What's it about?
No, what is it?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
You want me to burn my book?
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
See, isn't this nice?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
You can--you have the "gotta"--
What about a bee...?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Annie, what is it?
You've been out of your room.
Don't talk to me like that.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Yes, Paul.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
You won.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Before we kill her or cure her..
Range is two kay.
What can we do' mate?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
What's you name?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
So where did I got right?
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Have you met them?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Where do I meet you?
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Like what?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
'Terrorists?'
Excuse me?
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Very.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I don't.  No exactly.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Let's start from the inside out.
A visit from an old friend.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
That's S.O.P..
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
But why tell us?
Satisfied?
Donít Jim.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
What?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
I didn't say that.
What are you going to do?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire.
This is Kittridge.
No sir.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
I don't quite follow you.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
What kind?
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Why, may I ask?
Why should I?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Mm - Hmmm...
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
What sector's the air conditioning?
That's not it.  That's not the list.
The package is in the open.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
I thought I'd take some now.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
I knew about Jim.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Rita. Pass the wine.
You're welcome.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Where's Ma?
Here.  Ti amo. 
You look tired.
Yeah.
The guy died.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Yeah.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
You don't have to help me.
Stupid yourself.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
To the bed.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
What did I do?
Why not?
I'm telling you you can't.
So. Where are we sitting?
This is your place.
Why not?
You've gotta get outta here.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
You don't want the fish.
You never have dessert.
Have Something.
Alright. A month. In a month.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Have you told her we're getting married?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
I have no secrets from my family.
What?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Why not?
And we'll sell the house.
Your hair's different.
No.
We just come from the bank.
Don't fight.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
Who was that?
No idea.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Can I get another one of these?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Nerves.
You knew that man?
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
I don't know.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
I see.  Yes, of course.
Halt!  Who goes there?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
Who are the Britons?
The same!
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What word?
Then you shall die.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
What is your name?
Who ... Who breaks out?
Nu!
What?
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Where?
Behind the rabbit?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Good idea, O Lord!
He will be soon. He's very ill.
What is your quest?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Don't be such a baby.
Who's that then?
Why?
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Did you kill all those guards?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
But I don't like her.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Right.
Where are you going?
Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!
Well, she's got a point.
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
... I Bet you're gay.
Oh!
They're all saying the word ...
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Sixty.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
It's what the maids are for.
Checked and locked, sir.
Checked and locked, sir.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Do you know who you address, sir?
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
By whose authority?
Awaiting my orders.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What brings you here?
Do you hunt?
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Surely --
For Her Majesty.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Mr Brown.
And the pony?
Then why do you persist in doing it?
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
What are those?
Those, over there, there.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
We took a nip of whiskey.
Must they always follow us?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
I was told you were in a fight.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Well, both.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Why was I not informed?
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Why?
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Who told them that?
Why is he not here?
What is the matter with him?
Does that thing work?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
But how can it change every time?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Talk to me.
So where is he?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Where to now?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
The Police, then...
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Virgin sacrifices?
Jesus Christ!
You got the schematics?
What are you looking for?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
Okay.  It's West.
Our time's up.
It's the wrong way!
What did he do to you?
"Escape"?
So what do you think?
They fired everyone.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
But I'm not broke.
It's been a very strange day.
Will you meet with him?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Beautiful night.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Yes...what is it?
How...  how'd they know I was here?
I...
I guess I've come to quite a place.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
That's okay.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Hi.
Betty.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
What is it Rita?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
"So... surprise"...
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
No... but...
I don't think...
Yes, Sir.
Betty Elms.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
The one of 'em still alive?
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
You must come in first place to move on !
Is that it ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Come on, it works.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I... I .....
I wanted to let his family know....
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Do you know where you're going ?
That was eleven years ago.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
What's next Walt ?
Where ?
Don't.
Don't eat at the console.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
When I think you're ready.
Well ?
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
Will he make it out ?
What's next ?
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Look he figured it out !
What the ... ?
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Are you okay ?
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
What now ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Good morning.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
I don't think you're very polite.
THANK YOU.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
There's still a big spot on the floor.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Hi honey.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Can I see him?
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Thanks.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
And she saved it.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
He's writing. Hello?
Your mother?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
I think it's cool.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Come and get it.
Woah, watch it!
Where are you going???
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
It's dangerous!!
What's he smoking?
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Yeah?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Committed?
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Then you'll be all set.
He was caressing.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I mean...with your car.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
He's so tiny.
Let me hold him.
Really?
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
It's there.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
They're dead?
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Well the other night at dinner...
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Kinda like men.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
I haven't danced in.....
I ahh, better go.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
How's it going chef?
Shelly?
Well, you were pretty great!
Vada, we're trying to work here.
VADA!
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
She likes to play bingo.
Are they ready yet?
When?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Did I kill my mother?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Do you miss her?
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
This is one big house for one single person.
How much does it cost?
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Cause she's dying.
No.
Hi.
Did you read ALL these books?
What are they about?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Sure.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
I won, I won!!!
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
Daddy??!?!?!
Where's Daddy?
It's okay sweetheart.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Where's your bike?
Hey look at this!
No, I don't wanna.
Do you remember her?
Here.
Bed wetter!
Can we go yet?
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Get up!?
Why are you running away?
I do, she's real funny.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Seeya tomorrow.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Stay, huh?
I've lost interest.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He can't do that to me!
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
You flew all the way h...
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Two words.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
What else did he tell you...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
And the answer was so simple.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
About Michael's job.
So... one almost has to...
He'll see right through it.
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
I've been calling for days!
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
She's too genuine.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Waiter! Check, please!
Where was that, Florence, huh?
You never eat when you're despondent.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Big weddings are so strange.
Don't you throw up on boat?
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Takes me back.
Will she like it?
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
... your one chance for true happiness?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
I never forgot that.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
Because I could come...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
And to m...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
You're from out of town?
Then why are you listening to her -
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
You going today?
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
She's fine.
He has that sign with the tree.
You want anything?  A drink?
How much?
Where'd he ever see us?
Okay.
Howdy.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I need a room
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
You got a place to stay?
Wrecks.
What kind?
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
I don't know his first name.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
When did you start singing?
And before?
I'm not sure. Where?
I'd really like to see you.
I don't know who you are.
Hello.
Oh.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
How old are you?
Yes.
What time?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
You know Bill is really mad at you.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Southern California.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Ryan O'Neal.
You think it will?
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
More or less.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Divine intervention.
Looked like an interview to me.
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
You guys stay on your bellies.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Was what worth it?
Tell me about the purity.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
Yes.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
How immediate is immediately?
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
You can't be serious?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Two guys?
Three.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Could we go with you and film it?
Who's going to buy me a beer?
It sure is.
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
You a union man?
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
She done moved to Detroit.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Don't say much, do you?
Thanks.
And his age?
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
In Birmingham.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
But I would like to see you again.
What d'you mean?
No, on the porch.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
How old is your boy?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Don't push me, Duff.
I can see why.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Don't, Duff.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Day work.
How come you don't hate their guts?
I don't think that'll happen.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
That's right.
Good-bye, Frankie.
See you, Duff.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
They'll run you out.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
So I been told.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
No. Why?
Now you stay put!
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
We got any shots?
You're hurt...
What about her?
Easy...
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
Where the hell have you been?
How much time you got left?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
What about the mainframe's access code?
I know who you are.
I had to limit your options.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Maybe something's onto him.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Case... it's four a.m.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
He projects with neural implants.
I know.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
My God... these people are insane.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Who?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
How long will they watch us for?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
You don't think I can do it.
Senorita Josie.
Okay. That's bad.
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
You need my help?
Wow. It's packed.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
A--flack jacket.
Uhh, no.
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Gus?
What if I say no?
Hey there.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You having fun?
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Better person than I.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Wow, Josie- you look really-
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
This seat taken?
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
You have to say that. You're my student.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Please. Please don't walk away.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
By name.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Shock.
He sure is big, Jack...
Where're we taking him?
Yes.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Taste it.
Uh-huh.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
We're here!  You sent for us!
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
So, you live around here.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
You okay?
You know her?
Are you sure?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Here.
So, you feeling anything?
Any ghosts in here?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Disappointed?
About not finding any bogey men?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Who, Jesse?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What?
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
What's that?
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
You got five minutes.
It's over.  It's over.
Crossed over?
Anything?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
That's right.
Just until we get things under control.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
We're here.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Coffee?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Okay -- fine.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Yup.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Oh please sod off.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
But... wait... there are things to say.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
You were saying...
Sorry about that.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
What does it say?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
That's right.
Yup.
No.  Not true...
No!
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Do you want to stay?
This painting isn't the original, is it?
That's nice.
Hello, Bernie.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
I agree.
I did.
That's right -- Topol.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Do you ever masturbate?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Well?
Any more announcements?
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Hello.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Spike!
What's going on?
Are you sure you...?
How was she?
But you have no proof.
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Get up, Billy.
Oh, I had them removed.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
I hope everything is settled.
Good. Why don't you join us?
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
So long suckers.
Yeah, kid?
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Ahhh, Billy...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
They must be up there!
What?
I'll bet a dollar.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Did to me?
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
I'm busting outta this place.
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Don't you have any clubs?
Gimme the ball!
I wanna go home!
My turn.
Jesus God...
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Yeah!
Got a cigarette?
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Oh yeah...
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Yeah!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
What kind of crap is that???
Is everything all right?
At this hour?
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
What?...
Good.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
No.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Where are you going?
That's not the point.
You're limping.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Nice dress.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
What would you call it?
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
I'll look forward to it.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Well, to-- new friends.
What looks good?
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
No.
Come on, it's not so bad.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Kate, is something the matter?
Is that bad?...
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
What are you doing?
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
I never even got to be single.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Who said I was going?
Peter found him?
Whatareyoudoing?!
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
So...
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
She what?!
And you didn't tell her?
I have to talk to her.
Right now?
Well, where are they?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
It'll do.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
Working hard?
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Mm—hmmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
Wow... .
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Terry...?
I think we're O.K.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I can get home all right from here—
I'd better go in.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
Want to go out and have one with me?
It's quite—  –nice.
Now what are you doing?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
And if you don't?
You're not sore at me?
What are you crying for?
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I've been sittin' in the church.
Terry— what's happening to you?
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Edie...
Terry, no, no... .
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Your gun.
...walk?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Better.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
My favorite little cousin.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Maybe I will— one of these days.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You're talking nonsense.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
No. No! No!
I could make her another Cleopatra...
What're you talking about?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Ask him his name.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Oh, man.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Outside of that.
How long were you with the girl?
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
And she saw you?
You know they gonna set us up.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
What'd you talk about?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Daniel.  Listen --
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
You get the key?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Leave it where it is.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Quite a mess.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Hello?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Who's sitting here?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
None of your business.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
You like bourbon?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Wait in the car.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Thanks for your help.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Have they got Midge up there?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
But you're sure we've met, huh?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Gee, I wonder why not.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
It's a guy you know.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
You're not my type.
You like to sit down?
No.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
Technically.  They're separated.
He's about to.
No thanks.
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
You gonna go get him?
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
We have a problem here?
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
...the fuck is this...
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
I wish she could forget him.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
What lizard?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
They ready, Earl?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Good shooting, Danny!
How could you do this?
Nah, you go on.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Where are we going?
They're all over us!
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Danny...
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
How's everything?
Then wh-where do we land?
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Well sure, Colonel --
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
What's your name?
How often you fight like this?
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
What else can we do?
Rafe --
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
Hello, Lilla!
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
I'll call you Later.
I don't get it.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
How do you feel?
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, how are you?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
He's trying.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
What do you know about classical music?
Charlie. About last nights..
What are you doing here?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Did you study for the test?
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Don't get your hopes up.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
You don't?
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
You think so?
It's Charlie!
Damn that Charlie I
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
All right. But this better be good.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
I closed my Christmas club.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
The hat business is in trouble.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I have a note.
I'm excused.
Would you get that, dear?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
Where have you been?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
I remember that dress.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
You're giving me the creeps.
What're you doing?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
What do you know about hypnosis?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
Is something wrong?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How long ago did this guy retire?
What's wrong?!
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
What are you talking about?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
It's weird...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
You ever think about running away?
How did it go with your father last night?
Do you really think so, Andy?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
Jerk... What did you say?
We're not skipping this treatment.
Fuck you.
I'm not going to close the--
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
I'm not ready to die.
Whatever.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
I know that, Charles.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Take it easy, Walter.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Congratulations.
Kids are great.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Nine.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
PARRTYY!
I'm a law suit.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
We proceed, representing your estate.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Mom?
Were you recently promoted?
Objection!
We're going to draw blood.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Great.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Lots.
Joe?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Let's continue.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
There....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
How much?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Well? Is it just the pump?
Some prophet guy?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
New Mecca....
She's the captain, we should listen to --
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
How did you know we'd come here?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
The best. But we won't need them.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
The blood transfusion.
Now, just a minute --
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Which direction?
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Objection!
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
No cigar.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Lucius.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Sustained.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
Stop right there.
Twelve hundred years ago.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Then there is another jungle?
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Yeah?
You lame Taylor?
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Come on man!
Dawn! That was it!
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
You volunteered for this shit man?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Merle?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
You don't want to hear about it?
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Indefinitely?
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
The brush-off, huh?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think I'd like to dance.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
You tried to run away.
Bad?
Dance? Tonight?
Why not?
Then he's got to be a detective.
Us?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
I think you mean that.
Yes, Miss.
Beer or ale, Miss?
I'll have to know a little more than that.
FLorida?
We try to be decent.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Got it on you?
What'll you have, Margo?
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
How are your teeth getting along?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
It was lying where on the balcony?
In case you want to have us followed.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Information.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Mitchell was too drunk.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
A little something on account perhaps?
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
Passkey?
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Send that?
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
No suicide.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
And if you didn't believe me?
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
So far.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
How long have you had it?
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
History books are first onto the bonfires.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Shall we go?
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Thank you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
How's Mary?
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
It's terribly good.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
I called you a taxi.
In radio we're different.
I haven't seen much of you.
And the Argies.
You approve!
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
What have you been up to?
Hold those rights.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
We'll see what we can do.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Don't you gamble?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
How you figure?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
I can't do this.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Why should I?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Wild ride, huh?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
Yeah?  What?
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Nothing?
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Nice place.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Bye.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
What story did you give to Davis?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
You're looking well, Dutch.
What's he got?
What in God's name...?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We can reach an understanding on this.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
So do day jobs.
Three hundred.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Uh-huh.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Not... quite.
This isn't a date.
And that's the way the game is played.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Why not?
Okay.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
What id we run into someone I know?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
I've never treated you like a whore.
What did you do to him?
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Aw, don't... no...
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
I want to.
Edward, did you hear me?
What time's diner tonight?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Looks slow tonight.
He... he just does.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Want a pair of boots?
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
I'm just going to my room.
I got a dress.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Having a good time, Vivian?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
Does it bother you to hear?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
I fear I'll never see you again.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We'll never survive.
Singed a bit, were you?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Faster!
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Probably he means no harm.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
The Man in Black?
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Inigo.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Yes.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Rise and report.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Where's Fezzik?
-- anything you want --
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Sir. Sir.
Thank you for everything.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
Do you always begin conversations this way?
You are wonderful!
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
I want to duel him left-handed.
Yes.
I accept.
What's so funny?
-- get back, witch --
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Yeah, an hour.
Bye-bye, boys.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
"By the light, by the light,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
What is that?  A handkerchief?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Assume away!
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Maybe you're happy.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
It won't run a week!
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Not.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Get car.  Get car.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
By the sacred memory...

"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
People can hear you.
Okay.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
No.
No.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
What?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
I don't know.
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
I'm Mary's sister.
Where?
What's the matter?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Is Mary... in trouble?
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Arbogast said...
Stay here.
Yes.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
We could laze around here a while longer.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
For what?
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
You have something most girls never have.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
A man should have a hobby.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
She sounded strong...
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
That's it. 
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
May I see your license?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Recluse. Kinder word.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
Went out before service.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
My mother is not dead!
...Forty thousand dollars!
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
Your father?
There's no child here.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
Did you? Where?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
But what about lunch?
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
I won't let you say that!
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
We'll be coming to the opening.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Let me go! Let me go!
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
That's the one.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Fine, thanks.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
But I have some friends waiting.
I'd know him anywhere.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Could we go somewhere?
What?
Of what?
Dysfunctional --
I am in awe of it, Mother.
But who were they?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
What do you think, Brother?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
She's putting the titty back.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
How could that be, son?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
I am ahead of you.
Please do.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Quarter of twelve.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Now you listen to me, Rose --
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
She hasn't actually done anything...
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
It's twenty after one.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Yes, sir.
Rose, what are you doing up?
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Is this ill right?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Took your time gettin' here.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
I... I can explain...
I was going to tell him.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
Kittle...
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
What'd I say?
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Sons of bitches!
Jiminy Christmas.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
"A.D."
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
Wh... what... ?!
They... they shot me.
What day is it?
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Birth control's important.
Hey...
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
No, we're stealing.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
General Jim Beam, then.
He tried to kill us.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Arriving tonight
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You know what I mean.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You need a doctor.
Any preferences?
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
You see that?
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
I have felt him, my Master.
Han!
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
What's going on?
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Tell me.
He's my father.
Yes. It's you Leia.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You promise you won't tell?
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Yes Brad.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Well I want to leave.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Good God.
"Sweet Transvestite"
Feeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Are you - giving a party?
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Some people are very shy by nature.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
D'you really wanna call?
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I always knew you was pretty.
I thought it might be cute.
...Like you?
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Don't do that again!
Owe you what?
You busted?!
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
...That's an old one.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Few minutes?
Cost ya a buck.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
What's ya name again?
That's it? -- Completely?
...The juice is climbin' every week.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
How'd you know?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Excuse me.
I'm sure you are.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old?
Think about it.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
See how fast he is -- damn!
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Hey --
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
...Maybe I better forget it.
Why?
It don't matter.
It don't bother me none.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Ya really like her?
What gaps?
To see ya train.
...I can't haul meat no more.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
You got the will in there, don't ya?
You tricked me, damn you!
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
I'll get it.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
No, kid, you're a real hero.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Good heart, at what?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Good marrow, father!
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
I come for my lady Juliet.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
I have.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
By the hour of nine.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Pink for flower.
I will follow you.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Why did you do that?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Not to me, you know that.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
I better be getting that.
I'm a patriate.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
Where's my information?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
Then where is it?
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
What are you doing?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Yeah.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
You shoot alright.
It's been known to happen.
I ride with fat-boy...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Is that right?
Perhaps the police?
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Where to?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Something like that...
What's the difference?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
What's going on?
What's going on?
I borrowed that, too...
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
And what job is that?
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
You know him?
What's this?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Give me a cigarette.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Time to quit.
You have to stop doing that!
You speak French.
Do you have the tape?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
What the hell happened here?
Ready to roll, partner?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Well someone's gonna find them.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
I don't know...
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
And how do you figure we do that?
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You think he's bluffing?
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Here it is.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Oh Jesus...
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
It's too late...
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
What's wrong?
You're worth every last penny.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Yeah, I've seen him.
Test the product?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
And what's that?
What makes you say that?
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Don't you have to be here?
Sheriff Hogan --
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Shopping here?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
I didn't know you were coming.
Did they ever find out who they were?
This whole place?
Don't you want it?
Not in the trunk.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
Winner six!
The band has been playing over an hour.
I got my sources.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
So tell me what you know.
What?
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Yeah, that's right.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Carter, get off that stage!
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
What are you doing?
Well, hurry up.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
I have plenty of dates.
Carter?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
How do you know he's our man?
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
I'm not used to having a partner.
What's a Chinese heaven?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
We made it, man.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
What's going on?
You move well.
Are you okay?
I didn't know which side you were on.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
You know what a phone booth is?!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Good job.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
He was just doing his job.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
That silly-ass look on your face.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
You want more?
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
What?!
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
Oh no.
What a surprise!
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
Jesus...what do you want?
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Hmmmm?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
You sonuvabitch.
Where do we find him?
Yes.
Yes.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
"Nothing but net."
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's running after her.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Yeah.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Thanks.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
They made me put my hat back on.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
That's fair.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
I'm a work in progress.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Kind of isolated.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
About a minute...?
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Yes, I did.
Used?
Reporter?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
I'm going to kill myself.
He's going to be the pastor?
What happened at the luau?
You okay?  I'm closing.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
What?
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Am I what they had in mind?
Is that all right with you?
Happy New Year, darling.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
You go.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
You're a basket case.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
I love that dream.
Becky?
I love the symphony.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Go home for the weekend.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
Hello.
It's you.
Which means --
Why not?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
What are you going to do, Sam?
Why not?
And you're worried about him.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
When's the latest time you were out there?
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
You'll like it.
Dad, could you close the door?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
Dad?  About last night?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
What's wrong with Annie?
You said we could go to New York.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Do you like baseball?
Yes?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
It's a little derivative.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Oh.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
It takes time --
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
How do you feel?
Ramón -- you can't.
Go on. Spill it.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
What?
What can I do for you?
What?
Ride 'em cowboy)
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Yeah.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Oh God.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Go ahead.
It's not that easy.
You don't understand.
Fuck you.
: What are you up to?
What do you want from me, Colette?
It gets me through the day.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
I'm kind of busy.
We been through that.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
That's a good one.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
You're going to have to explain that one.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
No one ever noticed?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Shoot him.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
You got a name?
You think I'm a Judas?
I was getting to it.
I was trying to score some dope.
You've got no choice.
That's because he doesn't have one.
Please ... don't do this ...
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Resistance?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Last I knew.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Where?
Watching.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
How about that jeep?
Some.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
What is it?
The men said, nine.
I wonder where they're going.
What about our grenades?
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Worked, didn't it?
You get a translator, Captain?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Uh, oh.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
I'm listening, sir.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Maybe Caen.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
I'd like to go, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
You think he really believed it?
What's the profile?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
This evening is over.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Hi.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
That's unlikely.
But you never had a first date.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
No, you're not a guy.
I don't feel anything.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Why?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
What are you doing?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Morning.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
You think you know what this money is?
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Well...
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
What are these?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
So what's your job this summer?
Then call me tomorrow.
You have to meet Bess.
Yes.
No.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
I don't think so.
I don't think I am.
Okay, what did we just decide?
It sounded like you did.
Did you tell anybody?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Then don't do it.
Okay.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
No, really.
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
My car.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Give me my firebird keys!
Now you're back.
Well, let's find him.
It's not a charade, all this?
What?
Should I stay?
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
It's bad business.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
You want these people.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
Where are the guards?
This is not my problem.
What do I got for you?
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
I was just the accountant.
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
Pots and pans.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
They arrived.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
Can't we hold him?
Have you checked the...
He's broken his pattern.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
What if I said goodbye?
Hello? Ted?
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
And are the police sure about that?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
But you’ll never get away with it.
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
No way.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Where's Sid?
He hates Oliver Stone.
You’re the one who got away.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
You have every right to be upset.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Not good. How you doin?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Ssshh! What was that?
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Who are you?
You're getting obvious.
No, wait...
He tried to kill her first.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
That was good.
Who is that guy?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
..this week's TKE kegger...
..it's really about family and tradition...
I hate scary movies.
You ass.
What was that?
What do you want?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Can I help you?
Nope.
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Please, call me Gale.
Four? There are five.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
What do you know about trilogies?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Excuse me?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
What?
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Where are you Dewey?
Where's Gale?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Sidney, what happened?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Basements creep me out.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
No.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Yeah?
What? She asked.
You ready to party hard tonight?
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
Ready?
It's on the table.
I thought she was dead.
She can't get both of us.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Sshh... it's okay.
You heard me.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
I think you have the wrong number.
Hello.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?
Listen, asshole...
Is this some kind of a joke?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
So you better leave.
How do you know his name?
I wanna play a game.
Please don't do this...
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
What's his name?
Michael... Michael Myers.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Evening, ma'am.
What brings you out to these parts?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
I like it. It's... sexy.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
I was first to respond.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
I'm not here to fight.
Off the record. No cameras.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
I have no idea.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Are you alone in the house?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
For about two seconds.
So what's his reason?
She's saving herself for you.
What's Leatherface doing here?
There goes my chance with Sid.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Who?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
How's that?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
Already.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
What the hell's going on?
What do you mean?
What time is it?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
A woman...
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
You should be thanking me.
Just keep leading the way.
I... I don't follow.
Not here.
Who said this was murder?
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
It could be nothing.
How's that?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
He's preaching.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
He just may be nuts enough.
The fingerprints.
How did the fire fight end?
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Sorry about that... I just...
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How do you know all about this?
This is a waste of time.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
What are you going to say?
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
What is it?
Stay with him.
Are you absolutely certain?
This painting...
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Did their son see it happen?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
I've come now...
Told ya, didn't I?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Keep talking.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, sir.
Well, come on!
You want us to fire a shot if...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Futterman?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Well, you're a widower now...
You figger Scar means to kill us?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
It wasn't much of a letter...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Where?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
Stop that!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
I'll do it myself.
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Who was that?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Maybe an animal.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Oh
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Tomorrow.
Wait!  Will you desist!
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
How long has it been?
And your relations?
No, your marriage bed.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
It's a comedy.
There's never any
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
How?
Is it going well?
But nothing is happening.
Do you know it?
Who is she this time?!
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Cut round him for now.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
Another little problem.
Kit
The daughter of his enemy.
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
And--?
Your Majesty!
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
I do not know how to undress a man.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
You would not leave me?
There is time. It is still dark.
Oh, do not go
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
But all ends well.
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
I have spoken with your father.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
And her voice? Like lark song?
Is there a man?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
Only on expenses.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
So who's going to do it?
I won't be able to.
Finished.
That was good.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
How much did you pay?
You looking for me?
They know.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
No. Why should it?
Well, is it?
Parked outside?
Just one thing.
That's right.
Who was it?
Aroused and inflamed.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- instead of what he is --
-- which is --
So?
I don't thinkI can.
Sshh.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
I don't see the point in that.
Leave him alone.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Are you all right?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
What?
It's OK. There's no problem.
Downstairs.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Why do you want a room here?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred.
I'm sorry.
We already know. All about it.
So let's go.
Yes.
What?
What do we do here, David?
Here.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Hello.
Here?.
What do you do?
What's it about?
Do you think you could answer that?
It was some guy called Brian.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
And he's a patient of yours?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Do you think George is a fairy?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
Lester.
-- is that what this is all about?
I don't know.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
What're you doing later?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Is she all right?
No, I know.
I know.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
But aren't you...
You going to answer it?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
You know what I'm talking about.
Then it's not your problem.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Chopped liver?
Did you hear me?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
I asked you first.
... just, you could look very heavy...
You are.
You do know what money's like these days.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Yes, Buffums.
So how's Norman?
Where do you want to do this?
No.
Why not?
George...
Did you?
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
-- yeah.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
What's wrong?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- Jesus --
-- good afternoon --
Why?
Look about last night --
Well then what are you trying to do-
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- yes, George.
Call me!
Now, George --
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You're great.
Yeah.
George?
George.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Yeah, baby...
Great.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Right now?
What?
I've got to get her out of here.
-- well aren't you --
How come you took your own car?
What do you wanna know for?
Baby, please don't... I love you.
-- please, baby --
What? What? What? What? What?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
George...
No.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Well anyway...
Sit down.
Me!
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.

All right, who're you with? Jill?
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.

Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Who were you talking to?
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
I'd like a drink.
They get hair all over the place.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
It must be something.
I thought you said things were great with George.
-- Yeah, honey...
He does?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- He reached up and tore them.
That bastard.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- why?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
You're going?
What's wrong?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
-- yes, Jill.
Are you married?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Everything okay, son?
Yes?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Are you sure?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Yes.
I don't know.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Yeah.
Mommy...
Mommy!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
To my stomach.
What sort of injury did he have?
How did he manage to do that?
It's okay, really.
Grady?
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Beg pardon?
I did?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
No charge?
Perfect for a child.
What do you want me to do about it?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Of course I am.
Stay away from me!
Stay... stay away!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
I'll bring back a doctor.
Very nice to meet you.
can of itself be a problem.
Well, obviously some people can be
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
Right there.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Lowe's car-?
The moon's not down yet...
Please, Uncle Al.
Are you all right, Marty?
You booger.
I've been hearing noises in there.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
What is it?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
It could have been anything, Marty.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
What if I say no?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
Really.
SING!
But I'm fearful!
How come?  Sister?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
What?
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
No... it's fine.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh my! 
Is this... choir practice?
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Hurry, Sister!
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Like this place?
Shirelles.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
She's a pro.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Van Cartier.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
You have to help me
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
We need experience.
Who are all these people?
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Goddamn it!
Oh my Lord!
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
St. Anne's?
And all those like you.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
And the vow of chastity.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
So... hi there.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
You're my Olympic event.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
But... wait a minute...
You sent for me?
But -- why?
What are you doing here?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
No nothing.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
What'd she say?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
I have?
I can't go with you.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
But you didn't tell me!
It's done?
Well?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
A sweater.
It should be here any minute.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
An... entertainer?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
I don't understand.  Where is she?
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
Where?
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
He is a behemoth.
Your superiors are two days away!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Do you have these persons' wills?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Listen to what you say....
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Where are we going?
No, I couldn't...
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
What good is this?
What now?  Where is she?
Climb up!
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Other people?
My suitor?
He has proposed to me twice.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
These scars.  How did you get them?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
Why would you do such a thing?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
I have not been able to face him yet.
The church.
What was that?
Quickly, close it.
Use caution.
Where?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Can you help?
You... you are alive.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
All right then.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Well, what did you want?
Did you decide, sir?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
You know what, by God?
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
You like that Vaughan?
You believe in the Bible?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
I want to be baptized.
They let you out?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
They still around, your folks?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Who did you kill?
Well, I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Why not? It died?
So it died when it come out?
It was alive?
A boy or girl?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Huh?
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Yeah.
What brings you back?
Why are you here now?
Do you have family here?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Where will he go?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
What!
No! At least I don't think I am!
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
It's yours?
I didn't know you took pictures.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
What do you mean?
Slow down, huh?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Did you ever go back to see her?
What do you mean?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
It's for you.
Open it.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Does it hurt?
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
I figured he had a right to know.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Benefits?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Hi there, little brother.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Well?
Aren't you going to say anything?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
What are you talking about?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Here and there. Around.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Celebrate? What for?
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
You don't believe in God anymore.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
You said three minutes.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
You think so?
Cigarette?
You always run with the well open?
You must think I like losing.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
You want me to say that.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
You're welcome.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Yeah - where were you?
Nellie told us about it.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
You don't see any blood?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Men?
What happened?
Blow where?
How can we?  We're broke.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
With ME?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Like when?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Did you hear that?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
OH!
Are my seams straight?
And you've got cold feet.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
You all right?
How's the bottle?
Who needs vermouth?
Not you, Sugar.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Yeah - Josephine.
We don't have to run.
I always did.
I was it.
We could pass for that.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
It doesn't matter.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
I don't like no witnesses.
Anything today?
Oh?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
We got time off for good behavior.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Put it here.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Me?
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Want to switch berths with me?
Which one is yours - the big one?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I'm not interested at all.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
- opening of the Opera -
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
You collect shells?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Josephine.
The most wonderful thing happened -
One of whom?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Been waiting long?
Three?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Where's your shell collection?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Harmless - how?
What thing?
Have you tried?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Is that anything?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Really?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Good evening, sir.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Christ, Amy.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
Hey.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
It was such a long time ago.
Mom’s refining her strategy for DDay.
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Who’s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
And Kat was fully clothed.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Nothing, nothing.
That was a long time ago.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
I’m sorry?
Don’t patronize me. They’ve clearly been at this a while.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Would you grab my shampoo?
You shit!
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Is this for last night?
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
What?
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah. You?
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
I always wondered what happened with us.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
And you say all them people is dead now?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
You hurt, Daddy!?
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
You know somethin', Daddy?
You got two shirts on?
Who's winning, Mama?
'Bye, Mama...
Did you see Daddy?
Poor creature...
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Can I go day after tomorrow?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
Come, I'll take you home.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
What... are you?
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
Is it Cartman's mom?
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
You bastards.
What was that word, young man!?
Kyle?!
What's going on, Chef?
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Purpre mama!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Ber dada!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mph mph.
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
Oh my God...
That's gonna take a long time!
Dude, we don't have watches.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Oh, brother.
Stan!
Thank you, Kenny.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
We must take action on this immediately.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
You know I do.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
What if I just left?
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Yeah!
Got it.
Getting drunk is no solution.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
You're certain of that?
Why, didn't they say?
You gotta think of your old age.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
It's time we lock coordinates.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
OK...it's open.
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
What the hell are you doing?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
No, just enjoying the view.
So I've been told.
Carlo!
Well now what are we gonna do!
What the hell is that?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
How is it looking, Mac?
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
You a mini-golfer?
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Hey, you still here?
I hate fuckin' opera.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Sure, Sid.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Where'd you get this ball?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
I do what I gotta do to survive.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Son?
My poor baby!
Hello?
I don't like to talk about it.
Who's there!
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Leave him alone!
132, 154.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Yeah.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
He's not here.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
This is a vicious cycle.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Whoa.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you have a boyfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Do you talk with your mom?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Nothing.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
Can I come with you?
Theo, Buzz is dead.
Very professional.
Some unfinished business.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Very good, busyboy.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
There's heat coming the door.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
They told me about sixty hours.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Nobody move.
But you've tested it?
Thirty yards.
Thank you, Colonel.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Maybe older --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Harry's missing.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
Wait a second --
Going active.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
I see it.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
How much damage?
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
What?
She wired this system.
What's wrong?
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
They switched us over.
From the sphere?
What is that?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Norman!
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Where'd this come from?
Wait a minute.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
In Edmunds' things.
Don't tell me to calm down!
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry?
But I don't know how --
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
He translated it wrong.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Diphenyl parlene.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Parasolutrine?
It's like a sleeping pill?
Doesn't say.
It's an idea.
It's getting cold.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
You're lying --
You're insane.
Shut up, Beth --
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
Beth!
Stop it!
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
I don't get it.
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
For who?  The fish?
Then what is it?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
You holding up alright?
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
She's cracking, Norman.
Wisconsin's your answer.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
We're never gonna make it.
I can't reach her.
There is one possibility.
What does Norman already know?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
English?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
What was it?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Who are you anyway?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Are you sure you don't need it?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
The Kiber Crystal.
Of course, where you been kid?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
There are only three or four left.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
Well, I practice a lot...
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Are you safe?
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
How do you make him do that ?
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I don't believe it !
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
So ?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Shhhh...!
You don't look very happy to see me.
What's wrong with you ?
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Where'd it come from ?
What ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
It stinks, you goin.
Way to go, amigo !
Hey, Diz...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Good good, then it's all settled.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Well, yeah, sure...
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
What do you think you're doing ?
Mister Rasczak ?
All dead except one, sir.
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>?!
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain, what's the next move?
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
Time to impact...?
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
One hundred kilometers...
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
We're losing the pattern...!
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Evening, Annie.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
You haven't heard of it.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
But, but but but...
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
I...
No, I don't...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
What are you doing down there?
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Later on.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
That's right...
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Press still works.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Lookit that, up already.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
And I might have something important to tell you...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
Hi!
I've been thinking.
Mornin', Doc...
Town ain't got no courthouse.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Mornin, sister.
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
I'm very sorry to...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Izzat so?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Get him on the phone.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
But not that <u>way</u>...
You have to hide.
That's my...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
What?
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
Hello.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Why?
Arrest him.
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
What?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
I...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
You cool the broad out?
What's in all the bags?
<u>Find</u> it.
We got the permit.
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Do something.
...not at all...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Where are we?
We have to lose the window.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
Ben!  What's wrong?
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
I'm gonna call him.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Look she's upset --
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
Wow.  Who's that for?
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I said...
I could help with the debate.
This'll work, huh?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
This is my house too!
Hold lunch!
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
In high school.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
...your hating me.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
But you told us to starve.
Excuse me --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Where Ben?
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Still, please.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
What did you do?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
So why did y...
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
However many.  It's not enough.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
Look, you've never liked me...
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
She's devastated.
Can I look at the pictures?
So.  Hopeful.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Not yet.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
It's just an assignment.
They're my kids.
Why in the world would she t...
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
No prob. I'm cool.
Marty, ignore him.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Who is Jesus?
How did they execute him?
But still, you can't be sure.
But really, you never know.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
The camerawork's nice.
We're not ready.
We're not ready!
Mom?
We used pull.
Was anyone in my room today?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
What do you want?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Hey, Mikey!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
That's good.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's over there.
Fuck me hard!
OK.
I dunno...
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
That's good.
OK. Bye.
Scooby?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
--be prepared.
Well Filmore--
Are the labs in operation?
Go fuck yourself...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Good.
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Are we adrift--
Drop the anchor!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
I have your word, Mister President?
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Give that back to me.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Yes, sir.
Why do you think I ask?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Who do you think you're talking to?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I'm trying to, sir.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Right.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
How long will it take to receive them all?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
What else could it be?
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Then this is it.
War.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
At the bottom of mines?
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
We are?
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
How long were you in there?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah!
Uh, home, you know.
Sounds like a bummer.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Fuck it!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Yeah.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Wait. Hey, man.
What?
Yeah, man.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Great.
Yes! Free concert!
He paid you man.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Yeah, we're all above that.
Thanks. See man?
You okay, man? You okay?
Thanks, man!
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Deep down. Way down.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I'd love to read that.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Well, w-what happened?
Yes.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Jeff! Come up here!
Why we're just standing here.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Please?
Was that supposed to be me?
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
About things that are important to me.
Your completely missing the point.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk?
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It got that close.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Come on.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
I've run out of words.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Good, man.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Really?
So who are you?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Is that your driver?
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
You're not serious.
Would I get paid?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Me?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Tim?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Yeah?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
So where are you?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Diane?  Diane!
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
Hi, Jack.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
Oh... What are you working on?
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Hat-trick?
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Hello?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Is that you down there?
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
My best friend got pregnant.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Good party.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
Well....
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Oh, you --
Good.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Who's Norma?
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
What happened?
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Gordon Cole?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Of course it is.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
What's that?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
What are the notes?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Go away.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Have one of mine.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
He must be quite a guy.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
That's a lie!  They still want me!
Wanted what?
You heard him.  I'm a star!
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
This room has not been used for a long time.
Is that so!
That's what I told them.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
How is she?
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
And she's turned you into a servant.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
I don't feel like it right now.
Western Europe.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
We're from different worlds.
Let me kiss you.
You're not afraid are you?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Away. From you.
And now?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
Why should I believe you?
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
No!
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Why the empty cage?
Hey, where you going?
Do you have any theories about last night?
Can I give you a lift?
Yes.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Superman will return it.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Balefire on you, Selena!
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What is this place?
You look at them? How?
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Not enough vodka in it.
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You know what's the problem?
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
He really was!
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Do you really know Superman?
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
You're the best, Lois.
What kind?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
How many sugars?
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Wipe 'em out?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Is this whitemail?
Yeah? How's it look?
Can you do that?
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
No, we're just going down.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Thanks.  Let's go
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
What about you?
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
The picture looks blurry.
I thought you'd never get here.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
How would you know?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Small potatoes.
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Jimmy, how's the -
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
I don't?
I do?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Where were you?
I was right. you are Superman.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Gee. But --
I like trees.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
Where?
He has powers as we do . . .
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Superman! The --
You must be freezing.
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
What more?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Whoa. . .
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
We'll all fry.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
What I need this for?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
Mom...
I'd like to.
Are there any more at home like you?
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're just jealous.
Oh.
This??
So I've noticed.
Krypton!
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
What do you suggest, my dear?
Don't let me down.
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
Lara, please...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Lois, the kickback story...
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Can you really see through anything?
What color underwear am I wearing?
What's the matter, Otis?
I broke the man out of prison --
I gave him steady employment --
I gave him this new face.
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Then...when did she get better?
I'm...so sorry.
Alison.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
It just seems...kind of weird.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Because it's what we have to do.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Yes.
Your kids never cry.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
From what?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
That's right.
What do you mean?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
You heard what Abbott said?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Is this mine?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Should I keep reading?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
I don't want you to lie.
Dolores.
Why?
When?
That's the local bar?
Yes.
Need a hand?
Is this it?
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
We do.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Yes.
So you're just the thing we need.
Yes.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
You remember this?
You're going to blow everyone away.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Sidney is a liar!
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
I know Steve.  No.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
And who's feet is she on now?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
Bribing me again?
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Avidly.  He was staring.
And where was his wife?
Don't you know who that man is?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
Who else phoned?
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
We stick in each others craw.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
I didn't do anything!
J.J., if you think -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
You haven't told him yet...
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
What does that mean?
Where we going?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
You have to do what I say?!
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
You will.
Pain causes it?
This is tactically dangerous.
Drive for a minute.
Will it melt in there?
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Out of the way, John!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Mom?  You okay?
John, get out of the way!!
I love you.  I always will.
I know!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
You look like handmade shit.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
Are you afraid?
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Where you from, David?
What the hell are they doing?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
So what is it?
What?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
You live here, in Berlin?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Your mother, too.
Think you can get me any of that?
Mine's the Eleventh.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
How come?
I made no deal!
Did you call someone you knew?
Tough, tough!
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Who warned you?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
What telegram?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I have illegitimate children.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
I've remembered something else...
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
What do you think?
Great.
You must have a girlfriend.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
There's so much...
You cold?
What's he like?
Bag some Z's?
Thanks a lot.
Is this enough?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Don't say that.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
So much pain.
I bet you're ticklish.
I don't think I like this.
Sarah.
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Admittedly...
Are you finished?
Did you play recently?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
This is C.R.S.
That one did.
Where are we going?
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Okay.
They're watching.
Then, what good are you?
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
What do you think you're doing?
It's mine...
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Yes.
Hey there, Nickie.
Never better.
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
How do you mean, exactly?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
Yes.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
Oh... it's a game.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Get rid of them.
Dinner's in the oven.
You did?  How is he?
Is everything alright?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
What's this about?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I don't like her.
What gentleman, Maria?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
How concerned should I be?
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Just what I told you.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
I only saw Theo drive up.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
You're not telling us something.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
Well, this lot is full!
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
It's still an electric shock!
Are you working with her?
All the carvings.
What did it smell like?
What happened after you smelled it?
Are you coming to confess?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
I don't know.
What is that tune?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
Come on.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Is there something about the house?
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
What do you do?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Jeez.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Good night, Theo.
I've never had a pedicure before.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Not for you, clearly.
It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
Hey.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
What more is there.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Huh?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Steady on.
Too easy?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Same.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Didn't get it.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, are you always this sarky?
Ashamed.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
What line is he in.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
It was you.  Downtown.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Of the deal, man.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Been away a lot.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
What?
How we gonna get that lucky?
You know her?
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Pleasure.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Thanks.  You, too.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
...I wanted to make you happy.
...No, please.
...she can go up there.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Sure.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
She's a rare one.
Uh-huh.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...Oh, Jesus.
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Where you going?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
OK, how did you know?
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Ed, how're you holding up?
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
I don't work here. My wife does.
Yeah.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...Ed?
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Frank.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Behind you.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
How big is the sub-basement?
I think I should come with you.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Lieutenant!  It's me.
What does it say?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
What do you do?
We're not supposed to go back there.
Quiet!
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Oh no.  I smell it.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
How does it work?
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
Dr. Green...
What is it doing?
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
Help someone!
You smell that?
I don't believe it.
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
It's the busy season.
You want to book the flight?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
You take Japanese.
Lauren, right?
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
No.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What's that?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
Every time you and Marlon--
Arrah!
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Who were you talking to?!
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Now what?
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
Poopy day?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
This man's still alive.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Of what?
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Do they know?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
How can I reach you?
What do you think?
No. I haven't.
Jesus, Mulder...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Why?
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Why are you whispering?
How was it contracted?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
What? What's wrong?
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Cold...
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Agent Mulder --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Is she alive?
A virus?
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He hates me.
She adores you.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I do it all the time!
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Evil.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
That went well.
Well look at that.
They're hungry.
Who says?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
She changed the codes.
When did he lapse into the coma?
What about the legalities of this...?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
How's the patient.
What about the cat?
I need it.
We proceed assuming she is.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Ich weiss nicht.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Gestern bein heurigen...
Oh, that was many years ago.
...and buried him.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Wer ist da?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
...is there?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
...quarrel?
...anyway?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
You can help us.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Get the next plane.
Do you see what that means?
Next, Paine.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
A girl of spirit.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Do you know his number?
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Seems exciting.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Listen...
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You told them, didn't you?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...the best way one can, you know.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Find out?
Could he have been at all conscious?
Already gone.
Coffin?
...Popescu...
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Could he have been conscious?
I was told that he did not die at once.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Something wrong.
That's all you meant?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
...this time.
Where are you staying?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Bonjour.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
What about Moliere?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
One kilometer
Hi.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
Watch your language....
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Oh, please...
What do you care?
How come you know all this shit?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You will.
Is he a Nazi?
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
And belief follows?
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
You want a punch in the mouth?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
I didn't realize you cared.
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
More cultural than political.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Explain it so I can.
Who killed Manzetti?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
It was a nine millimeter.
Think about your father. Your sister.
I don't do that.
What part of Germany are you people from?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
What is happening?
What about chicken?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Hello...?
Shut up. Fuck you....
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
And what did you do?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
What do you mean?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
You're going to live here permanently?
Does he know?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Did the driver really freeze?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I tell you she's mine!
Where did you two meet?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
You forgot the Hula!
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
The Mamma's there too.
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Because you'd laugh.
Why?
Enzo, wake up!
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
... Everything.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
You still collect them?
You don't have that one, do you?
Can I come in?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Anybody can have a bad day!
I'm concentrating.
A drink to warm up?
In the lake?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
I'd better get back now.
... No?
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Jacques, you set a world record.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
What's wrong?
You want to lie down for a while?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Assassin!
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Please. Will you help me?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
So, now what?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
What are you doing here?
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Mom! We're eating!
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
But we're not open on Sundays.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Hammer, you alright?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
This is for "mama and the kids."
Sure.
Sure, I like my leopards
I'm sick.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Cut.
See you tomorrow —-
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
It's about the leopard.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come to look around?
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
It could be a man.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
It was you, Galbraith!
Then you found the leopard --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
What are you getting at?
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ——
On his back, I suppose.
On his back, I suppose.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Kiki?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Can it be that easy?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
Laurence!
Huh! Really? Hotels?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Are you all right?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Black suits you.
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
Then find another way.
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Who’s the money man?
Ever seen him before?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Oh... We split up.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
I take it your son is called Leon?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
The £1,000 is on account.
Trying to say something, Martin?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Fine...
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
Gluck.
Five seconds. Then you die.
You’re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what’s left of him...
What sums?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Who do they think I am?!
Good.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Why?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
W-w-what are you doing?!
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Really?
Who are you?
The English??
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
How old are you?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
Thanks be to God.
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
You will??
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Supposing she's an assassin?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Does he have hair?
Wait, wait...
So... what is the message?
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
What's going on?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
And... what does Jeanne think?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Do you know how to count?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Yes...
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
But you already confessed this morning...
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Then... why are you here so often?
Beautiful.
Someone you know?
Who are you?
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Sit.
What did I tell you?
For what? For my tie?
Henryk's in there.
Can you help?
And suppose they take the table away?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
You sell anything?
What did you pay him?
I can look after myself!
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
But I want to help, I want to.
Why didn't you come to me?
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Pig!
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
What the hell are you doing?
Where are you hiding?
What about you?
Watch your feet!
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
She looks tired.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
What's in here then, lead?
Oh no, it can't come now.
We can't leave the piano
Hello, then.
Mama.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
Twist, you know this guy?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
I like griftin'.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
How'd ya do?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
You beat him, kid.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Raise 1,000.
See and raise 1,000.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
You done?
You got a back door to this place?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
Looks like he missed ya.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
You really picked a winner, kid.
You stayin' in or not?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
You weren't hired to miss him.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
How are you?
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
What is it? Has he found him?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother!
Is your father still in there?
Another Martini --
Aren't you Nick Charles?
How did you ever remember me?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Why... in the heart.
Hello, Dorothy. 
Dead?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
How's your brother?
That woman!
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
Nothing.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
No proof?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Well, what'd you think?
Who're you calling?
Trail him!  Trail who?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Are you kidding?
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I know.
Who's that man?
I don't like him.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
I never had it.
Did you get my money?
I'm not telling anyone.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
How are you?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
It might.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Why do you say that?
Pretty girl.
Good. I want to talk to you.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
There's one coming.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Finished with these?
But Wynant --- ?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You dog!
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
Yes!
I've got a lulu -- why?
Mimi!
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
How did you get in here?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
What are we going to do!?
What are you doing.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
We've got rope?
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Where'd they go?
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Wes--
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
What!?  What!?
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Take the binoculars.
They'll shoot us!
What?
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
You didn't step on any mine.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Why you got to move away to talk!?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
How's this going to work?
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Where the hell is it!?
They're going to kill us!
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Wonder how the war's going?
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
Just let me rest for a second.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Oh, God...
Slip out your M-16.
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
...Wes...?
Well?
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
He's not slowing.
Some good ones.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
That's in two days.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps...
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
You down?
What the hell are you doing!?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
I think he wants something to drink.
Drug evasion with....
Then why did you bring it up?
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
It's the end.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
What?
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Not very encouraging.
Where's LUH?
I'm leaving.
Which way?
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
That's not it.
She's not there
No...no you're wrong.
Yes.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
May I help you?
Just do it.
Who the heck're you?
Now wait just a fucking-
So what were they doing here?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Right.
Why do you do it?
Which one's which?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
It's working.
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Fuck factor?
Something round, two wires ...
What... ?
Right.
Then why tell me?
What the hell was that?
You touch me again and--
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
What about the ballistics report?
What the hell's going on?
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
How're you guys doing?
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
What was it this time?
Vice cop on a homicide?
What?
Yes, sir.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
It's our only option.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
Eleven o'clock! 
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
<u>Niente!</u>
What did you talk about?
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
No.
Nice day, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Yes, Baron.
I don't want to see you at all!
I hope you find the figures correct.
Two weeks and three days.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
Very well, m'sieu.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Thank you, Major. 
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Disappointed?
Please.
The pepper, too?
The fourteenth of May.
Two fifty-three, five--
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Filiba ...
Five, seven, and nine--
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
What shade of powder do you use?
Do you know my first name?
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
It's disgraceful!
Beautiful.
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
Then why do you want to go?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Lovely.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
About what?
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Yes, madame?
I beg your pardon!
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Who's the best? Say it.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Holy shit.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
We're too late.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
You told me to change.
An accident?!
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
No thanks. I'm heading back.
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
How you two doin'?
You're distracting me. Go away.
The fall alone would kill you.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
I'm Jack Dawson.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
A whole ten cents?!
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Are you nervous?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
It's bad.
You have to go for help.
I'm sorry.
It's been 84 years...
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Feeling a little better, I see.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Did you find it?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
Yes--are you?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Where have you been hiding?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
There's soft music--
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
What are you thinking?
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
What?--
How well do you know her?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
Nix, the law!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Thank you, sir. 
Three Jacks.
It's your deal.
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Hello, Denby!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
I didn't--
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What for?
Can you read 'em Jack?
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Yes, Yes!
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Nothin'.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
What d'you think of the singer?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
I asked where you got him.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
You don't even know him.
How you feeling, Doc?
Not exactly...
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
You know, we might just pull this off.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
What is it?
Just answer.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Really?  You sure?
'Least you admit it.
Well hello, Sherm.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
Florentino!  He's getting away!
What'd you do that for?
I don't like it.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
I just got it fixed.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
You'll never make that stick.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Virgil?
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
How did you get this number?
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
What about the uranium?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
His newspapers?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
That's reassuring.
Natalya?
She married a hockey player.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
They point, I shoot.
... Kids?
Bourbon. Neat.
Have we met?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
No?
Do I have to do everything around here?
... Do you have a gun?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
He's killed closer.
Sometimes you just have to -
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
... Yes?
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
Sorry I'm late -
Damn. It's doing it again.
The back-up does the same thing.
He brought that up from the wreck.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Oh, no.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Will it go off?
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
I'm busy.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
Not anymore, not in the city.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Your feet are cold.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You're always taking his side.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
It's good to be able to hear that.
What, are you having another party?
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Man, act like this is your home.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
You invited me.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
How are you?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Woody!  Buzz!
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
What are you doing over there?
We're almost there.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
What's going on?
THAT is Sid!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
What happened to you?
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Come on, this way!
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Great!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Something's screwy here.
Hey, watch it!
B-3.
Are you peeking?
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
That ain't no happy child.
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
W-w-w-we?
I'm red this time.
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Woody?!
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
Who's there?
Reprieve.
Surely she is older?
I already lost everything once.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Everything is gone, now.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
Why does he need money?
How much?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
Don't bother.
I think she's lying.
This is different.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Oh, it is?
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Is this bad for him?
Hi.
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
...How old are you?
She knows Arnie Metzger.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Yes.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
You first.
A group of us are going out tonight.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
My work keeps me young.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
She's not at that place you sent her?
Oh, man --
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
What?
I'm sorry.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Twenty thousand.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Where are you going, Diane?
Holding hands?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
What do you want?
Well, it isn't.
You're too young.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Happy birthday.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
You take the test?
Have you got any gear on you?
Thanks, Mark.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Screenwriter?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
What?
What was your price?
That's tough.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
The Sick Boy method.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
A walk.
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
With a starship!
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
What's going on?
You caught me on my way to the shower.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
No, but you can bet they will.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Ah, Captain?
Oh, God
Jim.
Goodnight, Spock.
I could use a shower.
But he does seem familiar?
Spock.
You must allow us to act.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock?

They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Why not?
Sybok.
You did break in.
Hi, Alan.
Want one?
How's it going upstairs?
Did he say why?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
What for?
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Dumont!
Flynn!!
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Not us, I hope.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
So...how's the world of serious science?
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Thank. you, Master Control.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Yes, MCP.
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
What do you think?
Do you know what he's talking about?
I'm done.
Dad, how come you know the words?
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Harry?  HARRY?!
Thanks dear.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
There's another guy, still in the car.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Give me the page.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--

This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
I'm late.
That's fabulous Harry.
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
What did happen?
Why did you continue to see him?
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
I think so.
Natasha?
17 years.
No.  But I wanted to.
Do you still love me?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Yeeaoowww!!
Hello?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
And you chased one?
What is it you want me to do?
To our assignment.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What do you want me to do?
Let me speak to Clarence.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Has he looked through it yet?
Tell him to look through it.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Ask me them again. One by one.
Burt Reynolds.
Like it?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
What's that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You're a whore?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
What?
Live with what?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Clarence?
What?
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Clarence...
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
In case of what?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
What?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
What do you want from me?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I've seen him.
What are you talkin' about?
That Vietnam movie?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Just put it in your purse.
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
No, sir!
Him?  You saw that man?
Women will want to get to know you...
I understand.  There'd be no point.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
That's him.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Change what?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
Hiding?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
You used to call me "James".
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
They're keeping an eye on me.
We need gas.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You want me to rob him?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
What....???
What...???
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Uh, that message...me?
He was fully sedated!
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You have him in restraints.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
You afraid of the dark?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
Can I help you, sir?
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
How much time?
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
No!
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Taking a little trip?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What's the matter?
It's Grace.
Jesus.
Thank you, John.
Where you coming from?
You've been around.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I don't know how.
How far is it to California?
Jake.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
You got a suitcase?
To get my car.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
What?
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
John, throw me the keys.
It's . . . it's locked.
No.  I swear it.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
I have half a mind to--
Would you?
Hungry?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
You love her, but you hate her?
Drop it, Jake.
I came for Grace.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
I call the policia.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I think I've heard that before.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Christ, I don't believe this!
Mister!
Now, what's this?
A lot that means.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
What the fuck do you want?
You've got to be--
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Wait a second--
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would you?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
What happened to your hand?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
What the hell happened to my car?
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
Two-hundred.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Look, Harlin.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Got any cold soda?
That's right on my way.
I got it.
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You never did answer my question.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Are there snakes out here?
Did you ever?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
What's the matter?...Grace?
You'd never understand.
What about us?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Morning, officer.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Genuine Draft?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
I want to stay.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
I'm listening.
...I can't remember.
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
What about the game?
I thought he was carrying something.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
I don't know what you're asking?
I have to go now.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
Yeah?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
How many did you put on that time?
I'm sleeping in my room.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
You like sports?
Not really.
In the passenger car?
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
He said...
He didn't say nothin', huh?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
He tell you where them others is?
I thought... you was an angel.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Scouting?
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Are you really going to kill them?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Hit your finger, huh?
What's all that wood?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
They really got all that money, them whores?
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Like I said, I...
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A sign on him?
What'd Ned say?
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
That was... the first one.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Shit.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
No.
Yeah?
Worms was comin' out.
Who's he?
Hullo, paw.
Three.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Well, suppose he does?
What was the money for?
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
They just said they wanted time.
I love you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
No killing?
Keaton, I can't just -
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
A little of both.
What do you mean I can't see him?
When does he post bail?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
This is going to drive the ante up.
Say it.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...of Anesthesiology?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Mr. Concannon...?
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Dr. Thompson...?
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Then why don't you testify?
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I had a witness disappear on me.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Listen to me, fella...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
I'm a lawyer.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
And it's over...?
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Thank you.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
...he's a good man...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Been a long time, huh...?
So what?
How are you holding up?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
What happened in those three...
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
How often does this happen?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Nothing.
Hello?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
About three years.
I told you! Right here!
Mmm.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
You don't even want to touch me.
Mmmm.
Come here.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Scottie!
Can't you see?
Where are you going?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
Scottie, please...!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
I made it.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Why am I here? What happened?
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
Oh... wandering about.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
One shouldn't live alone.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Have you been here before?
No!... No!
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
How do you know?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Yes --
Go on.
Here with you.
Yes.
No... we're together...
Where?
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Ow!!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Could be.
I think I can lick it.
Easy, now.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
Is she pretty?
Midge!
Just wander.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
What have you been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
She's fucking hot!
What's that?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
You're an asshole Adam.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
We have to call the ambulance.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Are you sure this was an accident?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
So that's what we're doing.
We have to get going.
What?
Who? What are you talking about?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
Don't snap at them!
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
Real times.
If anything ever happens to me...
I want you to hear me out.
Have you thought about what I said?
Money?
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
What is it?
Who?
Yup.
That's right.
He's right.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
We need padded chairs.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Oh God. This is insane.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
He's cracked up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What's your point?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
Nope.
False.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
May we have the rings please?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
The wedding cake check?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I wouldn't know.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's weird.
Do you love me?
Keith do not trivialize this.
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Will you please call the chair people?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
How late?
What's the word on the chairs?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
What kind of stupid question is that?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
So what do we do?
But...
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Just kills me...
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
The first day.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
Greenpeace.
I guess.
Shut up Micheal.
Where's the camera?
Are there many windows?
Which couch?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
What do you mean?
You must think I'm mad.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
You believe me, don't you?
Me?
My God, what have you done to him!
Ramona! Ramona!
If you wake first, wake me up.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
She isn't my cousin.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Miss Viridiana ...
Well... is it so urgent?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
Don't say that.
It's a very big one.
Yes -- very, very big!
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Don't talk like that!
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
She looks like a sick marrow!
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
I should have told him.
What happens if I can't catch him?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Get that fucking thing away from me!
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
You need a maid.
Should I have?
My God...
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You ready for this?
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
I am impressed.
Who said that?
She's beautiful, you know?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
More or less.
Where the hell are you going?
Then shoot him already.
Where's John?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
...tonight...
What about it?
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
...mmm?
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
It won't hold.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
What crisis?

Tell me again.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
...you want us to go to War...
...they sound what?
What do you know about them?
Precisely.
...can we see the Kitten...?
We'll be back tonight.
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.

Why do people go to war?
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
What do you want the kid to say?
Who?
"The Country Is At War." 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
What do we have that they want?
...who is this guy...?
You can't have a war without an enemy.
W...what?

...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
Jim Belushi...?
...as of today, 89% favorable.
Oh huh...
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Hey the door was open.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Sell?
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
Don't start, alright.
Whatever night you like.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
You sure?
So, where are we going?
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Yeah, right...
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
How do you know?
My home number's on the back...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
I guess I'll head back...
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Hello Bud.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
...isn't it perfect!
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
How you doing Buddy?
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
He still likes you
Businessman?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Hello?
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Oh that explains everything.
Well?
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Anyone else not coming?
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
Well?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Can this be stopped?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Stop saying things so loud!
Yes?
I know that.
Of course you will.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
What?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
What?
How?
You think you influenced her?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
No.
How're you holding up?
No.
He was so pissed.
How you holding up?
Jody--
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Someone's there.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
But Claire--
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
I guess not.
When's she out of here?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's okay if you're not.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Of what?
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
What are you doing here?
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
"...for my father."
Our house.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
See?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Tonight?
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
I may have seen her on campus.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
...I'm positive this time...
I was there.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Stop...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
Do you know it?
I know.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Rowan.
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
I beg your par---
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I don't want the -
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Lasher - bring us through!
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
A girl...?
Do not tell me that!
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
What do you see...?
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Stop it.
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
I heard something like that
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Sounds good - thank you
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
It doesn't mention 'females only'
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
I don't know
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Tell me how it happened...
And how did it feel to be rid of him
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What is it?
Where are you going?
I don't like sugar
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
I thought it was you - how are you?
That's good
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Sugar?
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Who the hell was your father?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
You guys are my parents.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Well?
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
Can you believe that was me?
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
My legacy.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
My new bike.
You're a peach.
That's a crappy thing to say.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Me?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Why can't you be nice to me?
I mean my father.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Come on.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You promise you'll finish school?
But who would run the store?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You do like girls, don't you?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
I do?
I told you you could do it.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
My father must've been amazing.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
How you doing, Artie?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Merritt, Forensics.
You okay?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
How long?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Eliminate the competition.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
About a year ago.
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
What?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Davy.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
That was about as grim as it gets.
How...
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sandy... What's up?
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Aha!
You feeling all right?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
Well... that, too.
So... what happened?
Uh... how long ago was this?
You might have mentioned you had that.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Can you fill me in here?
Oh, damn!  That's it.
It is?
When we find him, he is mine.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
He calls it the Tarantula.
A new friend?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
You're not that big.
The first.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
I beg your pardon?
Well?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are very important, Willow.
They look like acorns.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
Then you get us out of here.
Who is that girl, anyway?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Time to change her diaper.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
Watch it!
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Who are you!  Who are you!
You must learn magic.
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
Ouch!!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Madmartigan.
Ohhh, I hate this.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Nail it!
What are you going to do?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Where are you taking us?
What was that?
Now what's the problem?
Oh? Anything else?
Where are you taking us now?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Enjoying your reading?
Your husband's?
Sure.
You admit you're lying?
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
What's so funny?
God, Fred...
Is the English dead?
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Get back in there.
To see?
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
From now on you'll be history
Our echo.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
...have you come back?
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Toto's my dog.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
...Toto, too?
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Aw, come, come, come --
That's our farm!
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Where do you want to be oiled first?
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
And him a brain.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
...has been simply unbearable.
Yes -- let's run!
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Does it work?
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Um-hmm.
I don't blame you for that.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Up!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
I haven't slept in weeks.
Whozat?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
That's right.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh, dear, dear.
...to Dorothy!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
What about us?
-- Ruined my exit!
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
Nuclear.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Beautiful, isn’t it?
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Who is he?
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
I can’t stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
Then take me with you.
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
What are you talking about?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
I’m coming with you.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
So you killed your father.
The Maiden’s Tower.
What?
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
No idea who's behind this?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter --
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
A whore fucking.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Jon, where are we?
No.  I just wanted you to --
I¹m not.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Damn straight.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
His what?
Old?
-- What is it.
Laurie --
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
They're practically on us . . .
What?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Dan -- what do we do now?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
. . . That was quick.
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
What caused it?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
But programmable. And expendable.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Like what?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Aren't you afraid?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
I can see that. Why?
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
What...?
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
That's the guy.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
What's this?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wish I could go.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
What do you say?
Let go.
He takes himself seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Come with me and I'll let her live.
The point of what?
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
Is that so?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Yes, sir.
Surprised?
Miss me?
Surprised?
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
Good night.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
There seem to be quite a few books.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
I didn't do that.
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
But, sir...
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
Are these your bags?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Aye-gor!
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
You can't win 'em all.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Where is he?
All right -- where is she?
Thanks...for all your help.
I'm a failure.
What monster?
How's everything?
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
Would you like a sandwich?
Look, Doctor!
It looks that way.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Yes, I have mine.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Three minutes to go!
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Yes, sir, name, please?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Stuart?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
